abstract = {Despite the very active deforestation of the last decade, the Amazon Basin is still primarily covered with trees and is a system in equilibrium. The Andes form a barrier at the western end of the basin and, coupled with the prevailing easterly winds, ensure an almost unique precipitation and water-recycling regime. On average 50 percent of the precipitation is recycled, and in some areas even more. The soils are poor. Most of the nitrogen and phosphorus is found in the soil, and the remaining nutrient elements are found in the standing biomass. There is some nutrient recycling and little loss from the intact ecosystem, and the small input of nutrients from precipitation maintains a small positive nutrient balance. Continued large-scale deforestation is likely to lead to increased erosion and water runoff with initial flooding in the lower Amazon, together with reduced evapotranspiration and ultimately reduced precipitation. Reduced precipitation in the Amazon could increase the tendency toward continentality and adversely affect climate and the present agriculture in south-central Brazil.},

abstract = {What hydraulic information can be gained from remotely sensed observations of a river's surface? In this study, we analyze the relationship between river bed undulations and water surfaces for an ungauged reach of the Xingu River, a first-order tributary of the Amazon river. This braided reach is crosscut more than 10 times by a ENVISAT (ENVironmental SATellite) track that extends over 100 km. Rating curves based on a modeled discharge series and altimetric measurements are used, including the zero-flow depth Z0 parameter, which describes river's bathymetry. River widths are determined from JERS (Japanese Earth Ressources Satellite) images. Hydrodynamic laws predict that irregularities in the geometry of a river bed produce spatial and temporal variations in the water level, as well as in its slope. Observation of these changes is a goal of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission, which has a final objective of determining river discharge. First, the concept of hydraulic visibility is introduced, and the seasonality of water surface slope is highlighted along with different flow regimes and reach behaviors. Then, we propose a new single-thread effective hydraulic approach for modeling braided rivers flows, based on the observation scales of current satellite altimetry. The effective hydraulic model is able to reproduce water surface elevations derived by satellite altimetry, and it shows that hydrodynamical signatures are more visible in areas where the river bed morphology varies significantly and for reaches with strong downstream control. The results of this study suggest that longitudinal variations of the slope might be an interesting criteria for the analysis of river segmentation into elementary reaches for the Surface Water Ocean Topography mission that will provide continuous measurements of the water surface elevations, the slopes, and the reach widths.},

abstract = {An analysis of the Amazon basin hydrologic cycle has been carried out using the NASA/Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-1) atmospheric reanalysis, observed rainfall of Xie and Arkin [1996], and historical Amazon River discharge. Over a seasonal cycle the precipitation is found to vary by 5 mm d-1, and the runoff is found to vary by 2 mm d-1, while the evaporation largely remains constant. On interannual timescales the hydrologic variability both in the atmosphere and at the land surface is found to be closely related to El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The correlation between the Southern Oscillation Index and Xie and Arkin precipitation is 0.8 for the period 1985-1993 and 0.56 for the period 1979-1996. The precipitation lags behind the Southern Oscillation Index by 3-4 months while the Amazon River discharge lags behind the precipitation by another 3 months. The lagged relationship suggests interesting dynamic mechanisms. The reanalysis moisture convergence and observed discharge are used to diagnose basin average soil water storage. The year to year variation in the annual mean soil water storage is ∼200 mm, comparable to the change within a climatological seasonal cycle. In one case, the basin soil water storage increases by 462 mm from September 1987 to March 1989, suggesting the remarkable ability of the tropical rain forest environment to store and take up water.

Surface snowfall identification is a feature newly added in the classification module to the recently released version to provide a surface snowfall flag for each qualified vertical profile. This algorithm is developed upon vertical features of Ku- and Ka-band reflectivity and dual-frequency ratio from DPR. In this paper, we validate this surface snowfall identification algorithm with ground radars including NEXRAD, NASA Polarimetric Radar (NPOL), and CSU-CHILL radar during concurrent precipitation events and GPM validation campaign Olympic Mountain Experiment (OLYMPEX). Other ground truth such as Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) and ground report is also included in the validation. Based on 16 validation cases in the years 2014-18, the average match ratio between surface snowfall flag from space radar and ground radar is around 87.8%. Promising agreements are achieved with different validation sources. Algorithm limitation and potential improvement are discussed.},

abstract = {Satellite-derived rainfall products are useful for both drought and environmental monitoring, and they also allow for tackling the problem of sparse, unevenly distributed and erratic rain gauge observations provided. their accuracy is well known. Venezuela is a country highly vulnerable to extreme weather events such as extensive droughts and flash floods; therefore, an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of satellite-based rainfall products is useful for the planning of water resources. Using numerical metrics in order to evaluate performance, monthly rainfall estimates, from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation and Stations (CHIRPS v.2) product, are compared to gauge data from the 1981-2007 interval and categorical metrics for assessing rain-detection skills. The analysis was performed considering different rainfall categories, seasonality, and spatial context. The results show that the satellite product CHIRPS v.2 overestimates (underestimates) low (high) monthly rainfall values; although on the majority of numerical metrics of skill shows a good performance. This product, on the other hand, achieves better performance during the rainy season (April-September), significantly overestimating, however, the rainfall-events frequency. The product also shows best overall performance over flat and open regions (e.g., Los Llanos), where precipitation is influenced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone activity and local convective systems.},

The last 10 years have featured various " once in a century " droughts and floods in the Amazon basin, which have affected human and natural systems in the region. We assess a history of such hazards based on river data, and discuss some of the observed impacts in terms of vulnerability of human and natural systems, as well as some of adaptation strategies implemented by regional and local governments to cope with them. A critical perspective of mitigation of drought and flood policies in Amazonia suggests that they have been mostly ineffective in reducing vulnerability for the majority of the population, constituting, perhaps, exam-ples of maladaptation via the undermining of resilience.},

abstract = {Patterns of surface sediment concentration distribution in rivers are significant for understanding fluvial morphodynamics and environmental characteristics of the rivers and their floodplains. In the case of the Amazon Basin, complexity in sediment pattern distribution is affected by the anabranching channel pattern of the Amazon River, inputs from tributaries (some of which are among the largest rivers on Earth) and the existence of huge and complex floodplains. In this paper, patterns of surface sediment distribution are modeled based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over the Amazon River by estimating surface sediment concentrations. Specifically, we aim to 1) detect the regional and seasonal variability of surface sediment in the main channel, 2) observe the influence of tributaries into the main system, 3) identify channel-floodplain interactions, and 4) investigate the internal variability of surface sediment along the main channel system. Field surface sediment concentration data from three gauging stations representing the upstream, midstream, and downstream sections of the Amazon River between 2000 and 2010 were used to calibrate 1328 MODIS daily surface reflectance images. Robust empirical models were derived between field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data from each station (0.79<R2<0.92, slopes significant at 99% confidence level) from 752 selected data after quality control. We applied empirical models to 2112 8-day composite surface reflectance images to generate surface sediment distribution maps since 2000. Overall, this study successfully demonstrated the capability of our MODIS-based model to capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface sediments in the Amazon River Basin, the largest river system on Earth. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Aghakouchak2015a,
abstract = {This review surveys current and emerging drought monitoring approaches using satellite remote sensing observations from climatological and ecosystem perspectives. We argue that satellite observations not currently used for operational drought monitoring, such as near-surface air relative humidity data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder mission, provide opportunities to improve early drought warning. Current and future satellite missions offer opportunities to develop composite and multi-indicator drought models. While there are immense opportunities, there are major challenges including data continuity, unquantified uncertainty, sensor changes, and community acceptability. One of the major limitations of many of the currently available satellite observations is their short length of record. A number of relevant satellite missions and sensors (e.g., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) provide only a decade of data, which may not be sufficient to study droughts from a climate perspective. However, they still provide valuable information about relevant hydrologic and ecological processes linked to this natural hazard. Therefore, there is a need for models and algorithms that combine multiple data sets and/or assimilate satellite observations into model simulations to generate long-term climate data records. Finally, the study identifies a major gap in indicators for describing drought impacts on the carbon and nitrogen cycle, which are fundamental to assessing drought impacts on ecosystems.},

TMPA is available both after and in real time, based on calibration by the TRMM Combined Instrument and TRMM Microwave Imager precipitation products, respectively. Only the after-real-time product incorporates gauge data at the present. The dataset covers the latitude band 50°N-S for the period from 1998 to the delayed present. Early validation results are as follows: the TMPA provides reasonable performance at monthly scales, although it is shown to have precipitation rate-dependent low bias due to lack of sensitivity to low precipitation rates over ocean in one of the input products [based on Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B)]. At finer scales the TMPA is successful at approximately reproducing the surface observation-based histogram of precipitation, as well as reasonably detecting large daily events. The TMPA, however, has lower skill in correctly specifying moderate and light event amounts on short time intervals, in common with other finescale estimators.

abstract = {An innovative remote sensing approach that combines land-use change and water quality information is proposed in order to investigate if Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) area extension is associated with water siltation in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River Basin (Brazil), containing the largest small-scale gold mining district in the world. Taking advantage of a 40-year period of the multi-satellite imagery archive, the objective of this paper is to build a normalized time-series in order to evaluate the influence of temporal mining expansion on the water siltation data (TSS, Total Suspended Solids concentration) derived from previous research. The methodological approach was set to deliver a full characterization of the ASGM expansion from its initial stages in the early 1970s to the present. First, based on IRS/LISSIII images acquired in 2012, the historical Landsat image database (1973–2001) was corrected for radiometric and atmospheric effects using dark vegetation as reference to create a normalized time-series. Next, a complete update of the mining areas distribution in 2012 derived from the TerraClass Project (an official land-use classification for the Brazilian Amazon) was conducted having IRS/LISSIII as the base map with the support of auxiliary data and vector editing. Once the ASGM in 2012 was quantified (261.7 km2) and validated with photos, a reverse classification of ASGM in 2001 (171.7 km2), 1993 (166.3 km2), 1984 (47.5 km2), and 1973 (15.4 km2) with the use of Landsat archives was applied. This procedure relies on the assumption that ASGM changes in the land cover are severe and remain detectable from satellite sensors for decades. The mining expansion area over time was then combined with the (TSS) data retrieved from the same atmospherically corrected satellite imagery based on the literature. In terms of gold mining expansion and water siltation effects, four main periods of ASGM activities were identified in the study area: (i) 1958–1977, first occurrence of mining activities and low water impacts; (ii) 1978–1993, introduction of low-budget mechanization associated with very high gold prices resulting in large mining area expansion and high water siltation levels; (iii) 1994–2003, general recession of ASGM activities and exhaustion of easy-access gold deposits, resulting in decreased TSS; (iv) 2004 to present, intensification of ASGM encouraged by high gold prices, resulting in an increase of TSS.},

abstract = {This paper documents the spatiotemporal evolution of wet-day and dry-day frequency (WDF and DDF) in the western Amazon, its relationships with oceanic and atmospheric variability and possible impact on vegetation. WDF and DDF changed significantly during the 1980–2009 period (p < 0.05). An increase in WDF is observed after 1995 over the northern part of the western Amazon (Mara{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n basin). The average annual value of WDF changed from 22 days/yr before 1995 to 34 days after that date (+55% after 1995). In contrast, DDF increased significantly over the central and southern part of this region (Ucayali basin) after 1986. Average annual DDF was 16.2 days before 1986 and 23.8 days afterward (+47% after 1986). Interannual variability in WDF appears to be modulated by changes in Pacific SST and the Walker cell during the November–March season. This mechanism enhances convective activity over the northern part of the western Amazon. The increase in DDF is related to warming of the North Tropical Atlantic SST, which produces changes in the Hadley cell and subsidence over the central and the southern western Amazon. More intense seasonal hydrological extremes in the western Amazon therefore appear to be related to changes in WDF and DDF that occurred in 1995 and 1986, respectively. During the 2001–2009 period, an index of vegetation condition (NDVI) appears negatively correlated with DDF (r = −0.95; p < 0.0001). This suggests that vegetation in the western Amazon is mainly water limited, rather than light limited and indicates that the vegetation is highly sensitive to concentration of rainfall.},

abstract = {Adequate and accurate hydrological data is necessary to manage water resources, which are critical in developing countries where such information is limited. In recent years, global reanalysis datasets have been developed to provide this information in climatic fields and, more recently, in hydrologic fields. Nevertheless, these latest efforts have been limited to temporal coverage (∼30 years) and mostly simplified hydraulic scheme routing in rivers, which can be inadequate for regional and long term scale objectives. In this article, a dataset (called hydrological reanalysis across the 20th century [HRXX] in the Amazon Basin) was developed as a case study spanning back to the year 1900 through the use of: 1) a large-scale hydrologic-hydrodynamic model (MGB) forced by a long-term climatic reanalysis of rainfall (ERA-20CM) with bias removed; and 2) a data assimilation (DA) technique coupled with a localization method (LEnKF) to use several ground observations of daily discharge within a radius of influence. Several tests were assessed to find the best bias removal method, the optimal radius of influence for the localization method and the final HRXX dataset. A total of 114 hydrological ground observations of daily information were used for assimilation and validation purposes, and several statistics indexes were employed to assess their performance. Results indicate that both bias correction and the DA with localization method greatly improved the simulations. Overestimations of the peaks in the open-loop (OL) (free run) simulation, mainly in the southern and northern regions of the Amazon Basin, were removed, and recession timing in the east-central region, as seen at the {\'{O}}bidos gauge station, were corrected. An average performance of ∼0.6 and ∼0.7 of the Nash–Sutcliffe and Kling–Gupta indexes was reached, even when only a few of the longest ground observations were used, which can be representative of the oldest periods (since ∼1930). To assess extreme events, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used for maximum and minimum annual water level anomaly values, reaching 0.6 and 0.7, respectively, at the Manaus gauge station, which is remarkable considering that the analysis covers approximately 110 years. Considering the results of this case study and the global coverage of rainfall datasets, this methodology can be transferred to other regions in order to better estimate and create a hydrological reanalysis that adequately represents the hydrologic and hydraulic spatio-temporal fields.},

abstract = {This study addresses the quantification of the Amazon River sediment budget which has been assessed by looking at data from a suspended sediment discharge monitoring network and remote sensing estimates derived from MODIS spaceborne sensor. Surface suspended sediment concentration has been sampled every 10 days since 1995 (390 samples available) by the international HYBAM program at the {\'{O}}bidos station which happens to be the last gauged station of the Amazon River before the Atlantic Ocean. Remote sensing reflectance is derived from continuous time series of 554 MODIS images available since 2000 and calibrated with the HYBAM field measurements. Discharge shows a weak correlation with the suspended sediment concentration during the annual hydrological cycle, preventing us from computing sediment discharge directly from the water discharge. Accordingly, river sediment discharge is assessed by multiplying daily water discharge measurements by the suspended sediment concentration averaged on a monthly basis. Comparisons of annual sediment discharge assessed using both field and satellite datasets show a very good agreement with a mean difference lower than 1%. Both field and satellite-derived estimates of the sediment concentration of the Amazon River are combined to get an uninterrupted monthly average suspended sediment discharge from 1995 to 2007. Unlike the water discharge which exhibits a steady trend over the same period at {\'{O}}bidos, the 12-year suspended sediment discharge increases by about 20% since 1995, significant at the 99% level. In particular, the inter-annual variability is much more significant in the sediment discharge than in the river discharge. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Amazon Basin is Brazil's next frontier for hydropower, but alterations to the water cycle from climate change and deforestation could affect river flows fuelling electricity generation. This research investigated the effects of global and regional changes to the largest network of planned and existing dams within a single basin in the Amazon (the Tapajόs River), which altogether accounts for nearly 50% of the inventoried potential expansion in Brazil. Future hydrological conditions could delay the period of maximum daily generation by 22–29 d, worsening the mismatch between seasonal electricity supply and peak demand. Overall, climate change could decrease dry season hydropower potential by 430–312 GWh per month (−7.4 to −5.4%), while combined effects of deforestation could increase interannual variability from 548 to 713–926 GWh per month (+50% to +69%). Incorporating future change and coordinating dam operations should be a premise in energy planning that could help develop more resilient energy portfolios.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the representation of the air surface temperature and precipitation using high spatiotemporal simulations (3 km–1 h) of the WRF3.7.1 model in the central Peruvian area. It covers, from east to west, the coastal zone, the western slope of the Andes, the Andean Mantaro basin (500–5000 masl), and the Andes-Amazon transition region in the eastern Andes. The study covers the January months from 2004 to 2008. Three experiments were conducted using different topography and land use data sources: (1) a control simulation using the default WRF topography and land use datasets from the United States Geological Survey (USGS); (2) a simulation changing only the topography by using the SRTM topography dataset; and (3) a simulation changing the land use data of (2) by a new dataset adapted from Eva et al. (2004). SRTM topography performed better than the control simulation for representing the actual altitudes of 57 meteorological stations that were used for precipitation and surface air temperature data. As a result, the simulations of experiments (2) and (3) produced lower bias values than that of (1). Topography change (experiment (2)) showed improvements in temperature bias that were directly associated with linear modifications of -5.6 and -6.7 °C∙km−1 in minimum and maximum temperature, respectively. Increasing (decreasing) precipitation with topography or land use change was clearly controlled by changes in the moisture flux patterns and its convergence (divergence) in the Andes-Amazon transition. On the western slope, precipitation increase could be associated with the increase in easterly flow by the smaller altitudes of the Andes mountains in SRTM topography and by increasing evaporation with new land use. Inside the Mantaro Basin, low level moisture flux seems to control the rainfall changes. Overall, relative changes (positive or negative) in precipitation due to topography or land use change could reach values above 25%.},

abstract = {Land surface waters play a primary role in the global water cycle and climate. As a consequence, there is a widespread demand for accurate and long-term quantitative observations of their distribution over the whole globe. This study presents the first global data set that quantifies the monthly distribution of surface water extent at ∼25 km sampling intervals over 12 years (1993-2004). These estimates, generated from complementary multiple-satellite observations, including passive (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) and active (ERS scatterometer) microwaves along with visible and near-infrared imagery (advanced very high-resolution radiometer; AVHRR), were first developed over 1993-2000. The ERS encountered technical problems in 2001 and the processing scheme had to be adapted to extend the time series. Here we investigate and discuss the adjustments of the methodology, compare the various options, and show that the data set can be extended with good confidence beyond 2000, using ERS and AVHRR mean monthly climatologies. In addition to a large seasonal and interannual variability, the new results show a slight overall decrease in global inundated area between 1993 and 2004, representing an ∼5.7% reduction of the mean annual maximum in 12 years. The decrease is mainly observed in the tropics during the 1990s. Over inland water bodies and large river basins, we assess the variability of the surface water extent against related variables such as in situ river discharges, altimeter-derived and in situ river/floodplain water level heights, and precipitation estimates. This new 12 year data set of global surface water extent represents an unprecedented source of information for future hydrological or methane modeling.

Conventional observations through surface gauge networks provide the most direct measure of precipitation, although these are very much limited to land areas, with very few in situ measurements over the oceans. Weather radars, although providing a spatial measure of precipitation, are limited in extent and number. Satellite observations offer an unrivalled vantage point to observe precipitation on a global basis. Since precipitation is spatially and temporally highly variable, satellites are able to provide temporal and spatial samples commensurate with many precipitation characteristics. This paper provides an overall review of global precipitation estimation, providing an outline of conventional measurements, the basis of the satellite systems used in the observation of precipitation, and the generation, availability and validation of the derived precipitation products.

abstract = {Nine satellite rainfall estimations (SREs) were evaluated for the first time over the South American Andean plateau watershed by comparison with rain gauge data acquired between 2005 and 2007. The comparisons were carried out at the annual, monthly and daily time steps. All SREs reproduce the salient pattern of the annual rain field, with a marked north–south gradient and a lighter east–west gradient. However, the intensity of the gradient differs among SREs: it is well marked in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42 (TMPA-3B42), Precipitation Estimation from remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) products, and it is smoothed out in the Climate prediction center MORPHing (CMORPH) products. Another interesting difference among products is the contrast in rainfall amounts between the water surfaces (Lake Titicaca) and the surrounding land. Some products (TMPA-3B42, PERSIANN and GSMaP) show a contradictory rainfall deficit over Lake Titicaca, which may be due to the emissivity contrast between the lake and the surrounding lands and warm rain cloud processes. An analysis differentiating coastal Lake Titicaca from inland pixels confirmed this trend. The raw or Real Time (RT) products have strong biases over the study region. These biases are strongly positive for PERSIANN (above 90%), moderately positive for TMPA-3B42 (28%), strongly negative for CMORPH (− 42%) and moderately negative for GSMaP (− 18%). The biases are associated with a deformation of the rain rate frequency distribution: GSMaP underestimates the proportion of rainfall events for all rain rates; CMORPH overestimates the proportion of rain rates below 2 mm day − 1 ; and the other products tend to overestimate the proportion of moderate to high rain rates. These biases are greatly reduced by the gauge adjustment in the TMPA-3B42, PERSIANN and CMORPH products, whereas a negative bias becomes positive for GSMaP. TMPA-3B42 Adjusted (Adj) version 7 demonstrates the best overall agreement with gauges in terms of correlation, rain rate distribution and bias. However, PERSIANN-Adj's bias in the southern part of the domain is very low.},

Several methods for the retrieval of snowfall intensity from satellite have been proposed in recent times using passive and active sensors.

Although the variability of the Amazon hydrological cycle has been increasing since the late 1990s, its underlying causes have remained elusive. We use water levels in the Amazon River to quantify changes in extreme events and then analyze their cause. Despite continuing research emphasis on droughts, the largest change over recent decades is a marked increase in very severe floods. Increased flooding is linked to a strengthening of the Walker circulation, resulting from strong tropical Atlantic warming and tropical Pacific cooling. Atlantic warming due to combined anthropogenic and natural factors has contributed to enhance the change in atmospheric circulation. Whether this anomalous increase in flooding will last depends on the evolution of the tropical inter-ocean temperature difference.},

At finer scales the TMPA is successful at approximately reproducing the surface observation-based histogram of precipitation, as well as reasonably detecting large daily events.

abstract = {This study is a geochemical investigation of the Andean and Foreland basins of the Amazon River at high spatial and time resolution, carried out within the framework of the HYBAM research program (Hydro-geodynamics of the Amazon Basin). Monthly sampling was carried out at 27 gauging stations located in the upper tributaries of the Amazon Basin (from north to south: the Napo, Mara{\~{n}}on, Ucayali, Madre de Dios-Beni and Mamore Rivers). The aim of this paper is to estimate the present-day chemical weathering rate (CWR), as well as the flux of CO2 consumption from total and silicate weathering in the Andes and Foreland Amazon basins, and to discuss their distribution as a function of geomorphic and structural parameters. Based on the forward method, the Napo and other Ecuadorian basins present high silicate weathering rates in comparison with the other basins. We confirm that the Mara{\~{n}}on and Ucayali Rivers control the Amazon hydrochemistry due to the presence of salt rocks and carbonates in these basins. The Madre de Dios, Beni and Mamore basins do not contribute much to the Amazon dissolved load. This north to south CWR gradient can be explained by the combination of decreasing weatherable lithology surface and decreasing runoff rates from the north to the south. The foreland part of the basins (or Mountain-Lowland transition) accounts for nearly the same proportion of the Amazon silicate chemical weathering and carbonate chemical weathering fluxes as the Andean part. This result demonstrates the importance of the sediment accumulation areas in the Amazon Basin weathering budget and can be explained by the occurrence of a higher temperature, the deposition of fresh sediments from Andean erosion and a higher sediment residence time than in the upper part of the basin. With a total CO2 consumption rate of 744.103moleskm-2year-1 and a silicate CO2 consumption rate of 300.103moleskm-2year-1, the Upper Amazon River (Andes+Foreland part) is the most intense part of the Amazon Basin in terms of atmospheric CO2 consumption by weathering processes. It is an important CO2 sink by weathering processes but accounts for only somewhat more than half of the CO2 consumption by silicate weathering of the Amazon Basin. This result points out the importance of the Lowland part of the basin in the inorganic C silicate budget. The Upper Amazon accounts for 2-4% of the world's silicate CO2 consumption, which is the same proportion as for the southern and southern-east Himalaya and Tibetan plateau. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Global estimates of river dynamics are needed in order to manage water resources, mainly in developing countries where in-situ observation is limited. Remote sensors such as nadir altimeters can complement ground data. Current altimeters miss however a large number of continental surface water bodies. This issue will be largely resolved by the future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, thanks to its wide swath altimeter. SWOT will provide almost globally two-dimensional water elevation maps for rivers over 100 m wide and water bodies over 250 m × 250 m. During this research, we investigated the potential of SWOT to correct hydrological models on a global/continental scale, through data assimilation. For this purpose, an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE), also known as “twin experiment”, has been implemented. Model forcings and parameters were perturbed to jointly achieve global hydrological models (GHMs) uncertainties, which is the expected scenario in which the SWOT community will mainly evaluate the future SWOT data. SWOT-like observations of water surface elevation (WSE), flooded water extent (FWE), and/or SWOT derived discharge (Q) were used to correct modelled Q, WSE and FWE from a large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic model (MGB – portuguese acronym of “Modelo de Grandes Bacias”), using a Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The results indicate that SWOT products could largely improve hydrological simulations on a global and continental scale. SWOT-like discharge can reduce $\sim$40% of model errors in daily discharge. Furthermore, when anomalies of the WSE DA approach were implemented, the error reduction was even greater for all state variables compared to the absolute WSE DA, achieving average error reduction values of about $\sim$30% compared to $\sim$24%. Finally, the simultaneous DA of all the SWOT-like variables together reduces errors from $\sim$14% to $\sim$22% compared to the average of assimilating only one variable.},

Three dekadal (10-day) gridded satellite rainfall products (TAMSAT African Rainfall Climatology And Time-series (TARCAT) v2.0, Famine Early Warning System NETwork (FEWS NET) Rainfall Estimate (RFE) v2.0, and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)) are compared to independent gauge data (2001-2012). This is done using pairwise comparison statistics to evaluate the performance in estimating rainfall amounts and categorical statistics to assess rain-detection capabilities. The analysis was performed for different rainfall categories, over the seasonal cycle and for regions dominated by different weather systems. Overall, satellite products overestimate low and underestimate high dekadal rainfall values. The RFE and CHIRPS products perform as good, generally outperforming TARCAT on the majority of statistical measures of skill. TARCAT detects best the relative frequency of rainfall events, while RFE underestimates and CHIRPS overestimates the rainfall events frequency. Differences in products performance disappear with higher rainfall and all products achieve better results during the wet season. During the cyclone season, CHIRPS shows the best results, while RFE outperforms the other products for lower dekadal rainfall. Products blending thermal infrared and passive microwave imagery perform better than infrared only products and particularly when meteorological patterns are more complex, such as over the coastal, central and south regions of Mozambique, where precipitation is influenced by frontal systems.},

abstract = {The precipitation that falls on the continents defines the extent and nature of terrestrial ecosystems and human activity in them, all of which are adapted to and maintained by present-day precipitation. In essence, precipitation is supplied by moisture that either comes directly from the ocean, or is subsequently recycled from the continents themselves. Both the processes that control evaporation and the main mechanisms of moisture transport clearly differ between the ocean and the continent, thus within the context of a changing climate, it may be expected that the relationship between precipitation of oceanic and terrestrial origin varies globally and regionally, as will the influence of these two basic components of total precipitation on global and regional precipitation trends, especially in tropical regions. We describe an approach based on a Lagrangian technique for estimating the precipitation in a target region given the proportions of moisture transported from the two sources (ocean and continent) to reveal that the percentage of precipitation of oceanic origin has increased globally in the current climate (1980–2016). The greatest observed rate of increase is in the tropical regions; furthermore, the trends of precipitation in these regions are controlled by trends in precipitation for which the source of moisture is the ocean.},

abstract = {Accurate and timely precipitation data are essential for monitoring and forecasting of floods and droughts. Yet, a fully global near-real-time (NRT) product that simultaneously provides good performance in convection- and snow-dominated regions as well as in densely gauged regions is still lacking. We developed a NRT variant of the recently released historic Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) dataset. MSWEP-NRT provides gap-free, fully global precipitation estimates with three-hourly temporal and 0.1° spatial resolution, by optimally merging gauge observations (GHCN-D and GSOD), satellite estimates (CMORPH, GSMaP, IMERG, and TMPA 3B42RT), and atmospheric model outputs (GDAS-Anl and JRA-55). To produce MSWEP-NRT, we first merge the satellite- and model-based data using weighted averaging, with weights based on the performance of the respective data sources at surrounding gauges. Next, the merged data are cumulative distribution function matched to the historic MSWEP dataset, resulting in a consistent precipitation record from 1979 until the near present. Finally, daily gauge corrections are applied, using a novel scheme that accounts for differences in the UTC boundary of the 24-hour accumulation period of gauge reports. To account for latency differences among the data sources and potential disruptions in data availability, MSWEP-NRT estimates less than seven days old are progressively upgraded to include any new data that have become available. The product has a latency of approximately four hours. An independent evaluation using NRT gauge observations demonstrates the efficacy of our merging approach.},

abstract = {This study investigates the applicability of Satellite Precipitation Products (SPPs) in near real-time for the simulation of sub-daily runoff in the Vilcanota River basin, located in the southeastern Andes of Peru. The data from rain gauge stations are used to evaluate the quality of Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM–Early (IMERG-E), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation–Near Real-Time (GSMaP-NRT), Climate Prediction Center Morphing Method (CMORPH), and HydroEstimator (HE) at the pixel-station level; and these SPPs are used as meteorological inputs for the hourly hydrological modeling. The GR4H model is calibrated with the hydrometric station of the longest record, and model simulations are also verified at one station upstream and two stations downstream of the calibration point. Comparing the sub-daily precipitation data observed, the results show that the IMERG-E product generally presents higher quality, followed by GSMaP-NRT, CMORPH, and HE. Although the SPPs present positive and negative biases, ranging from mild to moderate, they do represent the diurnal and seasonal variability of the hourly precipitation in the study area. In terms of the average of Kling-Gupta metric (KGE), the GR4H_GSMaP-NRT' yielded the best representation of hourly discharges (0.686), followed by GR4H_IMERG-E' (0.623), GR4H_Ensemble-Mean (0.617) and GR4H_CMORPH' (0.606), and GR4H_HE' (0.516). Finally, the SPPs showed a high potential for monitoring floods in the Vilcanota basin in near real-time at the operational level. The results obtained in this research are very useful for implementing flood early warning systems in the Vilcanota basin and will allow the monitoring and short-term hydrological forecasting of floods by the Peruvian National Weather and Hydrological Service.},

abstract = {Water siltation caused by artisanal gold mining has impacted the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River Basin in Brazil for the past 40. years, however spatial-temporal information about changes in water quality and consequences to the aquatic environment is lacking. To address this, the Landsat satellite family sensors were used to retrieve total suspended solids (TSS) of the water of the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River from 1973 to 2013. An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed.},

abstract = {This study sets out to analyze the stages of water bodies in the Amazon basin derived from the processing of ERS-2 and ENVISAT satellite altimetry data. For ENVISAT, GDR measurements for both Ice-1 and Ice-2 tracking algorithms were tested. For ERS-2, the Ice-2 data produced by the OSCAR project was used. Water level time series over river segments of very different width, from several kilometers to less than a hundred of meters, were studied. The water level time series that can be derived from narrow riverbeds are enhanced by off-nadir detections. Conversely, the off-nadir effect may degrade the series over large bodies if not properly accounted for. Comparison at crossovers and with in situ gauges shows that the quality of the series can be highly variable, from 12. cm in the best cases and 40. cm in most cases to several meters in the worse cases. Cautious data selection is clearly a key point to achieve high quality series. Indeed, low quality series mostly result from inclusion of outliers in the data set finally retained for the computation of the series. Ice-2 and Ice-1 tracking algorithms in the ENVISAT data perform almost equally well. ENVISAT altimetry is clearly an improvement on ERS-2 altimetry. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Observational studies across the Amazon report a common occurrence of shallow water table in lowland valleys and groundwater-surface water exchange from small headwater catchments to large floodplains. In this study, we assess groundwater's role in the Amazon surface water dynamics using a continental-scale coupled groundwater-surface water model (LEAF-Hydro-Flood) forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis, at 2 km and 4 min resolution over 11 years (2000–2010). The simulation is validated with observed streamflow, water table depth and flooding extent. A parallel simulation without groundwater is conducted to isolate its effect. Our findings support the following hypotheses. First, in the headwater catchments, groundwater dominates streamflow; the observed variations in its dominance across the Amazon can be explained by the varying water table depth. Second, over large floodplains, there are two-way exchanges between floodwater and groundwater as infiltration in the wet season and seepage in the dry season, and the direction and magnitude are controlled by the water table depth. Third, the Amazon harbors large areas of wetlands that are rarely under floodwater and difficult to observe by remote sensing, but are maintained by a persistently shallow water table. Fourth, due to its delayed and muted response to rainfall, groundwater seepage persists in the dry season, buffering surface waters through seasonal droughts. Our simulations shed new lights on the spatial-temporal structures of the hidden subsurface hydrologic pathways across the Amazon and suggest possible mechanisms whereby groundwater actively participates in the Amazon water-carbon cycle such as CO2 outgassing from groundwater seeps and CH4 emission from groundwater-supported wetlands.},

Several methods for the retrieval of snowfall intensity from satellite have been proposed in recent times using passive and active sensors.

This paradigm imposes that errors are transferred from runoff to discharge, yet the analytical propagation of uncertainty from runoff to discharge has never been derived. Here we apply statistics to the continuity equation within a river network to derive two equations that propagate the mean and variance/covariance of runoff errors independently. We validate these equations in a case study of the rivers in the western United States and, for the first time, invert observed discharge errors for spatially distributed runoff errors. Our results suggest that the largest discharge error source is the joint variability of runoff errors across space, not the mean or amplitude of individual errors. Our findings significantly advance the science of error quantification in model-based estimates of river discharge.},

abstract = {A fundamental question connecting terrestrial ecology and global climate change is the sensitivity of key terrestrial biomes to climatic variability and change. The Amazon region is such a key biome: it contains unparalleled biological diversity, a globally significant store of organic carbon, and it is a potent engine driving global cycles of water and energy. The importance of understanding how land surface dynamics of the Amazon region respond to climatic variability and change is widely appreciated, but despite significant recent advances, large gaps in our understanding remain. Understanding of energy and carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere can be improved through direct observations and experiments, as well as through modeling activities. Land surface/ecosystem models have become important tools for extrapolating local observations and understanding to much larger terrestrial regions. They are also valuable tools to test hypothesis on ecosystem functioning. Funded by NASA under the auspices of the LBA (the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia), the LBA Data Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-DMIP) uses a comprehensive data set from an observational network of flux towers across the Amazon, and an ecosystem modeling community engaged in ongoing studies using a suite of different land surface and terrestrial ecosystem models to understand Amazon forest function.

abstract = {Biomass burning in the Brazilian Amazon is modulated by climate factors, such as droughts, and by human factors, such as deforestation, and land management activities. The increase in forest fires during drought years has led to the hypothesis that fire activity decoupled from deforestation during the twenty-first century. However, assessment of the hypothesis relied on an incorrect active fire dataset, which led to an underestimation of the decreasing trend in fire activity and to an inflated rank for year 2015 in terms of active fire counts. The recent correction of that database warrants a reassessment of the relationships between deforestation and fire. Contrasting with earlier findings, we show that the exacerbating effect of drought on fire season severity did not increase from 2003 to 2015 and that the record-breaking dry conditions of 2015 had the least impact on fire season of all twenty-first century severe droughts. Overall, our results for the same period used in the study that originated the fire-deforestation decoupling hypothesis (2003–2015) show that decoupling was clearly weaker than initially proposed. Extension of the study period up to 2019, and novel analysis of trends in fire types and fire intensity strengthened this conclusion. Therefore, the role of deforestation as a driver of fire activity in the region should not be underestimated and must be taken into account when implementing measures to protect the Amazon forest.},

abstract = {Mesoscale to synoptic-scale squall lines that form along the northeastern coast of South America as sea-breeze-induced instability lines and propagate through the Amazon Basin are investigated using data collected during the April–May 1987 Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE 2B).These systems, termed “Amazon coastal squall lines” (ACSL), have been noted by others, but details of the structure and evolution of the ACSL are limited. The present paper uses Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, radar, upper-air rawinsonde, and surface Portable Automated Mesonet data to describe the structure, dynamics, and life cycle of the ACSL. Twelve ACSL were sampled during ABLE 2B, and three cases are discussed in detail.The ACSL are discontinuous lines of organized mesoscale cloud clusters that propagate across the central Amazon Basin at speeds of 50–60 km h−1. The ACSL undergo six possible life cycle stages: coastal genesis, intensification, maturity, weakening, reintensification, and dissipation. Analysis also indicates that mesoscale clusters within the ACSL are composed of three distinct cloud components: a prestorm region that often contains towering cumulus, leading edge convection (LEC), and multiple, precipitating cloud layers in the trailing stratiform region (TSR).Divergence and vertical velocity calculations indicate deep vertical ascent in the LEC and a region of midlevel convergence (≈500 mb) in the TSR. The latter midlevel convergence is associated with a weak updraft above 500 mb and an unsaturated downdraft below. Vertical motions in the TSR are an order of magnitude smaller than in the LEC.Substantial shear in the low-level inflow occurs in all three case studies and, as suggested by model simulations, may play an important role in the longevity (24–48 h) of the ACSL. Profiles of equivalent potential temperature $\theta$e, taken from the prestorm, leading edge convection and trailing stratiform regions demonstrate that the ACSL stabilize the troposphere in their wake and remove a tropospheric minimum of $\theta$e. It is hypothesized that the removal of this minimum is accomplished both by direct mixing via vertical motions in the LEC ("hot towers") and also through detrainment in the multiple-layered TSR. Part I describes the structure and kinematics of the ACSL, while Part II deals with the heat and moisture transports of these systems.},

abstract = {Cirrus clouds determine the radiative balance of the upper troposphere and the transport of water vapor across the tropopause. The representation of vertical wind velocity, W, in atmospheric models constitutes the largest source of uncertainty in the calculation of the cirrus formation rate. Using global atmospheric simulations with a spatial resolution of 7 km we obtain for the first time a direct estimate of the distribution of W at the scale relevant for cirrus formation, validated against long-term observations at two different ground sites. The standard deviation in W, $\sigma$ w, varies widely over the globe with the highest values resulting from orographic uplift and convection, and the lowest occurring in the Arctic. Globally about 90% of the simulated $\sigma$ w values are below 0.1 m s-1 and about one in 104 cloud formation events occur in environments with $\sigma$ w > 0.8 m s-1. Combining our estimate with reanalysis products and an advanced cloud formation scheme results in lower homogeneous ice nucleation frequency than previously reported, and a decreasing average ice crystal concentration with decreasing temperature. These features are in agreement with observations and suggest that the correct parameterization of $\sigma$ w is critical to simulate realistic cirrus properties.},

abstract = {A new technique is presented in which half-hourly global precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave satellite scans are propagated by motion vectors derived from geostationary satellite infrared data. The Climate Prediction Center morphing method (CMORPH) uses motion vectors derived from half-hourly interval geostationary satellite IR imagery to propagate the relatively high quality precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data. In addition, the shape and intensity of the precipitation features are modified (morphed) during the time between microwave sensor scans by performing a time-weighted linear interpolation. This process yields spatially and temporally complete microwave-derived precipitation analyses, independent of the infrared temperature field. CMORPH showed substantial improvements over both simple averaging of the microwave estimates and over techniques that blend microwave and infrared information but that derive estimates of precipitation from infrared data when passive microwave information is unavailable. In particular, CMORPH outperforms these blended techniques in terms of daily spatial correlation with a validating rain gauge analysis over Australia by an average of 0.14, 0.27, 0.26, 0.22, and 0.20 for April, May, June-August, September, and October 2003, respectively. CMORPH also yields higher equitable threat scores over Australia for the same periods by an average of 0.11, 0.14, 0.13, 0.14, and 0.13. Over the United States for June-August, September, and October 2003, spatial correlation was higher for CMORPH relative to the average of the same techniques by an average of 0.10, 0.13, and 0.13, respectively, and equitable threat scores were higher by an average of 0.06, 0.09, and 0.10, respectively.},

abstract = {With the upcoming SWOT satellite mission, which should provide spatially dense river surface elevation, width and slope observations globally, comes the opportunity to assimilate such data into hydrodynamic models, from the reach scale to the hydrographic network scale.Based on the HiVDI (Hierarchical Variational Discharge Inversion) modeling strategy (Larnier et al. (2020)), this study tackles the forward and inverse modeling capabilities of distributed channel parameters and multiple inflows (in the 1D Saint-Venant model) from multisatellite observations of river surface. It is shown on synthetic cases that the estimation of both inflows and distributed channel parameters (bathymetry-friction) is achievable with a minimum spatial observability between inflows as long as their hydraulic signature is sampled. Next, a real case is studied: 871km of the Negro river (Amazon basin) including complex multichannel reaches, 21 tributaries and backwater controls from major confluences. An effective modeling approach is proposed using (i) WS elevations from ENVISAT data and dense in situ GPS flow lines (Moreira (2016)), (ii) average river top widths from optical imagery (Pekel et al. (2016)), (iii) upstream and lateral flows from the MGB large-scale hydrological model (Paiva et al. (2013)). The calibrated effective hydraulic model closely fits satellite altimetry observations and presents real like spatial variabilities; flood wave propagation and water surface observation frequential features are analyzed with identifiability maps followingBrisset et al. (2018). Synthetic SWOT observations are generated from the simulated flowlines and allow to infer model parameters (436 effective bathymetry points, 17 friction patches and 22 upstream and lateral ydrographs) given hydraulically coherent prior parameter values. Inferences of channel parameters carried out on this fine hydraulic model applied at a large scale give satisfying results using noisy SWOT-like data at reach scale. Inferences of spatially distributed temporal parameters (lateral inflows) give satisfying results as well, with even relatively small scale hydrograph variations being inferred accurately on this long reach. This study brings insights in: (i) the hydraulic visibility of multiple inflows hydrographs signature at large scale with SWOT; (ii) the simultaneous identifiability of spatially distributed channel parameters and inflows by assimilation of satellite altimetry data; (iii) the need for prior information; (iv) the need to further tailor and scale network hydrodynamic models and assimilation methods to improve the fusion of multisource information and potential information feedback to hydrological modules in integrated chains.},

abstract = {The authors simulated the effects of Amazonian mesoscale deforestation in the boundary layer and in rainfall with the Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (BRAMS) model. They found that both the area and shape (with respect to wind incidence) of deforestation and the soil moisture status contributed to the state of the atmosphere during the time scale of several weeks, with distinguishable patterns of temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Deforestation resulted in the development of a three-dimensional thermal cell, the so-called deforestation breeze, slightly shifted downwind to large-scale circulation. The boundary layer was warmer and drier above 1000-m height and was slightly wetter up to 2000-m height. Soil wetness affected the circulation energetics proportionally to the soil dryness (for soil wetness below ∼0.6). The shape of the deforestation controlled the impact on rainfall. The horizontal strips lined up with the prevailing wind showed a dominant increase in rainfall, significant up to about 60 000 km 2. On the other hand, in the patches aligned in the opposite direction (north-south), there was both increase and decrease in precipitation in two distinct regions, as a result of clearly separated upward and downward branches, which caused the precipitation to increase for patches up to 15 000 km2The authors' estimates for the size of deforestation impacting the rainfall contributed to fill up the low spatial resolution in other previous studies.

In the present study, we evaluated the use of the daily rainfall dataset from CHIRPS with spatial resolution of 0.05° for different purposes in the states of the Brazilian Legal Amazon. We compared monthly rainfall, annual rainfall indices and their trends calculated using CHIRPS data and rain gauge observations with a point-to-pixel analysis. The use of daily CHIRPS data provided mean monthly rainfall similar to that obtained using data from the rain gauge stations, but CHIRPS data tend to underestimate the values for the rainiest months. The correlation was usually lower in the western Amazon, especially during its rainy season. The same underestimation was observed for extreme rainfall indices. CHIRPS product produces more similar results to rain gauge data for the indices PRCPTOT, nP, and R95pad, while strong underestimate the most extreme rainfall indices (R50mm, Rx1day, Rx5days). For the 45 stations and 15 rainfall indices analysed, 63 significant trends were detected using rain gauge data, of which only 13 were detected using CHIRPS product. Therefore, the use of CHIRPS data does not well represent the trends in rainfall indices.},

abstract = {How useful are satellite-based rainfall estimates (SRFE) as forcing data for hydrological applications? Which SRFE should be favoured for hydrological modelling? What could researchers do to increase the performance of SRFE-driven hydrological simulations? To address these three research questions, four SRFE (CMORPH, RFE 2.0, TRMM-3B42 and PERSIANN) and one re-analysis product (ERA-Interim) are evaluated within a hydrological application for the time period 2003-2008, over two river basins (Volta and Baro-Akobo) which hold distinct physiographic, climatologic and hydrologic conditions. The focus was on the assessment of: (a) the individual and combined effect of SRFE-specific calibration and bias correction on the hydrological performance, (b) the level of complexity required regarding bias correction and interpolation to achieve a good hydrological performance, and (c) the hydrological performance of SRFE during high- and low-flow conditions. Results show that (1) the hydrological performance is always higher if the model is calibrated to the respective SRFE rather than to interpolated ground observations; (2) for SRFE that are afflicted with bias, a bias-correction step prior to SRFE-specific calibration is essential, while for SRFE with good intrinsic data quality applying only a SRFE-specific model calibration is sufficient; (3) the more sophisticated bias-correction method used in this work (histogram equalization) results generally in a superior hydrological performance, while a more sophisticated spatial interpolation method (Kriging with External Drift) seems to be of added value only over mountainous regions; (4) the bias correction is not over-proportionally important over mountainous catchments, as it solely depends on where the SRFE show high biases (e.g. for PERSIANN and CMORPH over lowland areas); and (5) the hydrological performance during high-flow conditions is superior thus promoting the use of SRFE for applications focusing on the high-end flow spectrum. These results complement a preliminary "ground truthing" phase and provide insight on the usefulness of SRFE for hydrological modelling and under which conditions they can be used with a given level of reliability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study provides an updated analysis of the evolution of seasonal rainfall intensity in the Amazon basin, considering the 1981–2017 period and based on HOP (interpolated HYBAM observed precipitation) and CHIRPS (The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations) rainfall data sets. Dry and wet day frequencies as well as extreme percentiles are used in this analysis, producing the same results. Dry-day frequency (DDF) significantly increases in the Southern Amazon (p < 0.01), particularly during September–November (SON) in the Bolivian Amazon, central Peruvian Amazon and far southern Brazilian Amazon. Consistently, total rainfall in the southern Amazon during SON also shows a significant diminution (p < 0.05), estimated at 18%. The increase in SON DDF in the southern Amazon is related to a warming of the northern tropical Atlantic Ocean and a weakening of water vapour flux from the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The increase in DDF in the southern Amazon is related to enhanced wind subsidence (ascendance) over the 10°S–20°S (5°S–5°N) region and to a deficit (excess) of specific humidity at 1000–300 hPa south of 10°S (north of the 5°S), which suggest a reduction of deep convection over southern Amazonia. Subsidence over the southern Amazon shows a significant trend (p < 0.01), which can explain the significant increase in DDF. Wet-day frequency (WDF) significantly increases in the northern Amazon, particularly during the March–May (MAM) period (p < 0.01), producing an estimated rainfall increase during MAM of 17% (p < 0.01) between 1981 and 2017. Significant changes in both WDF and rainfall in northern Amazon have been detected in 1998 (p < 0.01). After 1998, the increase in MAM WDF and rainfall is explained by enhanced moisture flux from the tropical North Atlantic Ocean and an increase in deep convection over the northern and northwestern Amazon. These evolutions in DDF and WDF and in the tropical atmosphere occur simultaneously with an increase in sea surface temperature in the northern Atlantic Ocean, particularly after the mid-1990s. These results provide new insight into rainfall variability and climatic features related to increasing dry season length in southern Amazonia. Severe recent droughts may be associated with the increase in DDF in the South. In addition, the increase in MAM rainfall intensity in northern Amazon after 1998 may be associated with several historical floods that occurred after this date.},

abstract = {This study investigated the potential of assessing the water balance in South America, at multiple scales, using satellite remote sensing precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets, terrestrial water storage changes from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and discharge measurements. The remote sensing precipitation datasets included those of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), whilst the ET constituents included the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). Uncertainties in precipitation and ET were evaluated using in situ measurements of 307 rain-gauge stations and 16 eddy covariance sites, respectively. The water balance closure and uncertainties were evaluated in 50 basins for the period 2003–2014, at different spatial scales and under different climatic conditions. Overall, MSWEP precipitation and GLEAM ET provided fewer uncertainties, whilst TRMM and MOD16 yielded greater bias and more errors. Better agreements between the TWSC from GRACE and the water balance were found in the large and medium-sized basins, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 42%, whilst small basins and those located in regions with subtropical humid climates, where precipitation did not present strong seasonality, had a RMSE around 130%, indicating that climate conditions can influence the water balance closure. The TWSC from GRACE and the remote sensing water balance estimations were in agreement for more than half of the evaluated basins, mainly those located in tropical climate regions. Greater bias and more errors were found in the estimations of discharge in the semi-arid basins, with low runoff coefficients. Despite the water balance based on remote sensing estimations remaining a challenge due to the large uncertainties in precipitation, ET, and TWSC, our results showed their great potential for assessing terrestrial water-cycle dynamics and understanding their spatial and temporal variability at multiple scales.},

abstract = {Satellite-based precipitation products are promising data sources for the hydrometeorological community. However, many of these products lack quantitative estimates of their uncertainty. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation study of the state-of-the-art satellite-based precipitation product: Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) research product (TRMM 3B42) in the middle and upper reaches of Heihe River Basin. The study area locates in arid and semiarid regions in the northwest of China. Both version 6 (V6) and the newly released version 7 (V7) TRMM 3B42 research products are evaluated through statistical analysis and hydrological modeling in this study. We find that the performance of daily TMPA products is climatology-dependent. For the study basin, TMPA products generally perform better in wetter than in drier climatology conditions. High False Alarming Ratio (FAR) and positive bias occur in drier areas, whereas TMPA products display negative bias in wetter regions. TMPA products perform worse in winter when snowfall occurs than in nonsnow seasons. The new V7 TMPA products perform better than V6 on both daily and monthly scales. Hydrological modeling results show that TMPA products are promising in streamflow simulation at ungauged basins in arid and semiarid regions, especially the new V7 whose integrated performance is comparable with that of gauge-based precipitation estimate. When model parameters' sensitivity in forcing precipitation is considered by model recalibration, performances of both two versions of TMPA products are improved, especially for the peak flow simulation in summer. This study can serve as a reference of uncertainty estimates of the TMPA research time precipitation products in hydrometeorological applications at a watershed scale.},

abstract = {<p>Abstract. Evapotranspiration (ET) of Amazon forests is a main driver of regional climate patterns and an important indicator of ecosystem functioning. Despite its importance, the seasonal variability of ET over Amazon forests, and its relationship with environmental drivers, is still poorly understood. In this study, we carry out a water balance approach to analyse seasonal patterns in ET and their relationships with water and energy drivers over five sub-basins across the Amazon Basin. We used in situ measurements of river discharge, and remotely sensed estimates of terrestrial water storage, rainfall, and solar radiation. We show that the characteristics of ET seasonality in all sub-basins differ in timing and magnitude. The highest mean annual ET was found in the northern Rio Negro basin (∼ 1497 mm year−1) and the lowest values in the Solim{\~{o}}es River basin (∼ 986 mm year−1). For the first time in a basin-scale study, using observational data, we show that factors limiting ET vary across climatic gradients in the Amazon, confirming local-scale eddy covariance studies. Both annual mean and seasonality in ET are driven by a combination of energy and water availability, as neither rainfall nor radiation alone could explain patterns in ET. In southern basins, despite seasonal rainfall deficits, deep root water uptake allows increasing rates of ET during the dry season, when radiation is usually higher than in the wet season. We demonstrate contrasting ET seasonality with satellite greenness across Amazon forests, with strong asynchronous relationships in ever-wet watersheds, and positive correlations observed in seasonally dry watersheds. Finally, we compared our results with estimates obtained by two ET models, and we conclude that neither of the two tested models could provide a consistent representation of ET seasonal patterns across the Amazon.</p>},

abstract = {A new retrospective satellite-based precipitation dataset is constructed as a climate data record for hydrological and climate studies. Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) provides daily and 0.25° rainfall estimates for the latitude band 60°S-60°N for the period of 1 January 1983 to 31 December 2012 (delayed present). PERSIANN-CDR is aimed at addressing the need for a consistent, long-term, high-resolution, and global precipitation dataset for studying the changes and trends in daily precipitation, especially extreme precipitation events, due to climate change and natural variability. PERSIANN-CDR is generated from the PERSIANN algorithm using GridSat-B1 infrared data. It is adjusted using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly product to maintain consistency of the two datasets at 2.5° monthly scale throughout the entire record. Three case studies for testing the efficacy of the dataset against available observations and satellite products are reported. The verification study over Hurricane Katrina (2005) shows that PERSIANN-CDR has good agreement with the stage IV radar data, noting that PERSIANN-CDR has more complete spatial coverage than the radar data. In addition, the comparison of PERSIANN-CDR against gauge observations during the 1986 Sydney flood in Australia reaffirms the capability of PERSIANN-CDR to provide reasonably accurate rainfall estimates. Moreover, the probability density function (PDF) of PERSIANN-CDR over the contiguous United States exhibits good agreement with the PDFs of the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gridded gauge data and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product. The results indicate high potential for using PERSIANN-CDR for long-term hydroclimate studies in regional and global scales.},

abstract = {A systematic method is proposed to optimally combine estimates of the terrestrial water budget from different data sources and to enforce the water balance constraint using data assimilation techniques. The method is applied to create global long-term records of the terrestrial water budget by merging a number of global datasets including in situ observations, remote sensing retrievals, land surface model simulations, and global reanalyses. The estimation process has three steps. First, a conventional analysis on the errors and biases in different data sources is conducted based on existing validation/error studies and other information such as sensor network density, model physics, and calibration procedures. Then, the data merging process combines different estimates so that biases and errors from different data sources can be compensated to the greatest extent and the merged estimates have the best possible confidence. Finally, water balance errors are resolved using the constrained Kalman filter technique. The procedure is applied to 32 globally distributed major basins for 1984–2006. The authors believe that the resulting global water budget estimates can be used as a baseline dataset for large-scale diagnostic studies, for example, integrated assessment of basin water resources, trend analysis and attribution, and climate change studies. The global scale of the analysis presents significant challenges in carrying out the error analysis for each water budget variable. For some variables (e.g., evapotranspiration) the assumptions underpinning the error analysis lack supporting quantitative analysis and, thus, may not hold for specific locations. Nevertheless, the merging and water balance constraining technique can be applied to many problems.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall are governed by complex interactions between climate and landscape perturbations including deforestation, fire, and drought. Previous research demonstrated that rainfall in portions of the Amazon Basin has intensified, resulting in more extreme droughts and floods. The basin has global impacts on climate and hydrologic cycles; thus, it is critical to understand how precipitation patterns and intensity are changing. Due to insufficient precipitation gauges, we analyzed the variability and seasonality of rainfall over the Amazon Basin from 1982 to 2018 using high-resolution gridded precipitation products. We developed several precipitation indices and analyzed their trends using the Mann–Kendall test (Mann 1945; Kendall, 1975) to identify significant changes in rainfall patterns over time and space. Our results show landscape scale changes in the timing and intensity of rainfall events. Specifically, wet areas of the western Basin have become significantly wetter since 1982, with an increase of 182 mm of rainfall per year. In the eastern and southern regions, where deforestation is widespread, a significant drying trend is evident. Additionally, local alterations to precipitation patterns were also observed. For example, the Tocantins region has had a significant increase in the number of dry days during both wet and dry seasons, increasing by about 1 day per year. Surprisingly, changes in rainfall amount and number of dry days do not consistently align. Broadly, over this 37-year period, wet areas are trending wetter and dry areas are trending drier, while spatial anomalies show structure at the scale of hundreds of kilometers.},

abstract = {<p>    Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is currently producing the ERA5 reanalysis which embodies a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis will replace the highly successful ERA-Interim reanalysis that was started in 2006 (spanning 1979 onwards), and will also encompass the period covered by ERA-40. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cycle 41r2 which was operational in 2016. Therefore, ERA5 benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, numerics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31km, compared to 80kmfor ERA-Interim, ERA5 has a number of innovative features. These include hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). The step forward regarding quality and level of detail is evident. Forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim.</p>    <p>    One important novelty of ERA5 is the availability within 5 days of real time which will serve users that need recent meteorological information in combination with a long and consistent climate record. Such guaranteed timeliness requires that the ERA5 reanalysis is generated as an operational product.</p>    <p>    The operational services in the Copernicus Programme build upon the massive European investments in mature science and technology. For climate reanalysis, this is a two-way interaction for ECMWF. On the one hand, ERA5 benefits greatly from the leverage of the developments in the IFS. On the other hand, the operational model development at ECMWF benefits from reanalysis. One excellent example of this is the Research and Development work performed within the European-Commission funded research projects ERA-CLIM and ERA-CLIM2.</p>    <p>    This paper provides an overview of ECMWF's atmospheric, ocean and land reanalysis activities. In particular, it presents the ERA5 reanalysis system and its performance. It also describes challenges that were encountered and their practical solutions. The outcomes of the ERA-CLIM and ERACLIM2 projects will be summarized. Subsequent developments in, and plans for, the IFS in support of future reanalyses, aligned with the ECMWF strategy, are described.</p>},

abstract = {The relationship between the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) and the seasonal cycle of the intraseasonal rainfall variability in the Amazon Basin (AB) are analysed using band-pass-filtered gauge-based gridded rainfall data for the 1980–2009 period. Intraseasonal events (IE) have been defined and selected based on extreme values of the first principal component (PC1) time series, which comes from the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis applied to the filtered rainfall data over the AB. A total of 132 IEs were identified with an average of approximately five events per year. About 25% of the total IEs in the Amazon region are not restricted to the eastwards propagating equatorially confined MJO and other mechanisms (e.g., through Rossby wave trains in the Southern Hemisphere) might play an important role. In addition, we find that the incomplete IEs (events that do not evolve through a complete life cycle) are associated with suppressed rainfall conditions over tropical South America. The development of the IEs over the AB, when compared with the different phases of the MJO index, shows a coherent relationship, where convective-based indices are able to better account their evolution. On a global scale, the upper-tropospheric patterns and the rainfall composites based on the PC1 time series show that the MJO is one of the main atmospheric modulator mechanisms of the intraseasonal rainfall variability over the Amazon region throughout the annual cycle. It is found that the intraseasonal variability is particularly important during the austral winter, when the percentage contribution with respect to the mean daily seasonal precipitation over some Amazon regions can reach 50%.},

Reduced rainfall was marked over the Rio Solimes/Amazon, along most Amazon tributaries and over the Balbina reservoir. In a smaller test area, a heuristic argument showed that P and W were reduced by 5% and 6.5% respectively. Allowing for TRMM 3B42 spatial resolution, the reduction may be locally greater. Analyses of diurnal rainfall patterns showed that rainfall is lowest over large rivers during the afternoon, when most rainfall is convective, but at night and early morning the opposite occurs, with increased rainfall over rivers, although this pattern is less marked.

abstract = {New precipitation (P) datasets are released regularly, following innovations in weather forecasting models, satellite retrieval methods, and multi-source merging techniques. Using the conterminous US as a case study, we evaluated the performance of 26 gridded (sub-)daily P datasets to obtain insight into the merit of these innovations. The evaluation was performed at a daily timescale for the period 2008-2017 using the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), a performance metric combining correlation, bias, and variability. As a reference, we used the high-resolution (4 km) Stage-IV gauge-radar P dataset. Among the three KGE components, the P datasets performed worst overall in terms of correlation (related to event identification). In terms of improving KGE scores for these datasets, improved P totals (affecting the bias score) and improved distribution of P intensity (affecting the variability score) are of secondary importance. Among the 11 gauge-corrected P datasets, the best overall performance was obtained by MSWEP V2.2, underscoring the importance of applying daily gauge corrections and accounting for gauge reporting times. Several uncorrected P datasets outperformed gauge-corrected ones. Among the 15 uncorrected P datasets, the best performance was obtained by the ERA5-HRES fourth-generation reanalysis, reflecting the significant advances in earth system modeling during the last decade. The (re)analyses generally performed better in winter than in summer, while the opposite was the case for the satellite-based datasets. IMERGHH V05 performed substantially better than TMPA-3B42RT V7, attributable to the many improvements implemented in the IMERG satellite P retrieval algorithm. IMERGHH V05 outperformed ERA5-HRES in regions dominated by convective storms, while the opposite was observed in regions of complex terrain. The ERA5-EDA ensemble average exhibited higher correlations than the ERA5-HRES deterministic run, highlighting the value of ensemble modeling. The WRF regional convectionpermitting climate model showed considerably more accurate P totals over the mountainous west and performed best among the uncorrected datasets in terms of variability, suggesting there is merit in using high-resolution models to obtain climatological P statistics. Our findings provide some guidance to choose the most suitable P dataset for a particular application.},

One year (August 1998-July 1999) of tropical rainfall estimates from the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) systems were used to produce monthly means of rainfall diurnal cycles at hourly and 1° × 1° scales over a domain (30°S-30°N, 80°E-10°W) from the Americas across the Pacific Ocean to Australia and eastern Asia. The results demonstrate pronounced diurnal variability of tropical rainfall intensity at synoptic and regional scales. Seasonal signals of diurnal rainfall are presented over the large domain of the tropical Pacific Ocean, especially over the ITCZ and South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) and neighboring continents. The regional patterns of tropical rainfall diurnal cycles are specified in the Amazon, Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, Calcutta, Bay of Bengal, Malaysia, and northern Australia. Limited validations for the results include comparisons of 1) the PERSIANN-derived diurnal cycle of rainfall at Rondonia, Brazil, with that derived from the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) radar data; 2) the PERSIANN diurnal cycle of rainfall over the western Pacific Ocean with that derived from the data of the optical rain gauges mounted on the TOGA-moored buoys: and 3) the monthly accumulations of rainfall samples from the orbital TMI and PR surface rainfall with the accumulations of concurrent PERSIANN estimates. These comparisons indicate that the PERSIANN-derived diurnal patterns at the selected resolutions produce estimates that are similar in magnitude and phase.},

The data set was used to run four established ET algorithms: the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL), the Penman-Monteith algorithm from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evaporation product (PM-MOD), the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). In addition, in situ meteorological data from 24 FLUXNET towers were used to force the models, with results from both forcing sets compared to tower-based flux observations. Model performance was assessed on several timescales using both sub-daily and daily forcings. The PT-JPL model and GLEAM provide the best performance for both satellite- and tower-based forcing as well as for the considered temporal resolutions. Simulations using the PM-MOD were mostly underestimated, while the SEBS performance was characterized by a systematic overestimation. In general, all four algorithms produce the best results in wet and moderately wet climate regimes. In dry regimes, the correlation and the absolute agreement with the reference tower ET observations were consistently lower. While ET derived with in situ forcing data agrees best with the tower measurements (R2=0.67), the agreement of the satellite-based ET estimates is only marginally lower (R2=0.58). Results also show similar model performance at daily and sub-daily (3-hourly) resolutions. Overall, our validation experiments against in situ measurements indicate that there is no single best-performing algorithm across all biome and forcing types. An extension of the evaluation to a larger selection of 85 towers (model inputs resampled to a common grid to facilitate global estimates) confirmed the original findings.},

@article{Mertes1996,
abstract = {Across the cratonic landscape of Brazil the Solimoes-Amazon River transports to its delta plain 1240 Mt of suspended sediment derived from Andean erosion and reworks another 3200 Mt of floodplain sediments. Distribution of these sediments has resulted in a variable along-stream pattern of geomorphology. The upstream reaches are characterized by sediment erosion in the main channel and deposition in floodplain channels that are an order of magnitude smaller in discharge than the main channel. Sediment deposition in and migration of the floodplain channels erases oxbow lakes of the main channel and yields an intricate scroll-bar topography that forms the boundaries of hundreds of long, narrow lakes. In contrast, downstream reaches are characterized by channels restricted by stabilizing, long-term, levee building and floodplain construction dominated by overbank deposition. Overbank deposition buries the scroll-bar topography, resulting in a flat floodplain covered by a patchwork of large, more equant, shallow lakes. On the basis of estimated rates of recycling of floodplain sediments, the modern floodplain of the Brazilian Amazon could have been recycled in <5000 yr, and is recycled more rapidly in the upstream than the downstream reaches. The cratonic interior is interrupted by structural arches that bound intracratonic basins. Four of these arches cross the valley of the main river system at intervals of several hundred kilometres and impart a tectonic imprint on the channel-floodplain geomorphology at this spatial scale. Structural arches appear to exert a primary influence by promoting entrenchment of the river as it passes through zones of deformation, thus restricting channel movement. For example, as the river crosses the Purus arch, the valley narrows to <20 km compared to an average of nearly equal 45 km, the water-surface gradient decreases, sediment is deposited, and yet the rate of channel migration is negligible. Hence, the effect of the arches is to create a landscape where, on the spatial scale of hundreds of kilometres, the river is confined and entrenched in its valley, is straight, and is relatively immobile. Local valley tilting apparently unrelated to the arch structures also imprints the geomorphology. In particular, a tilted valley in the upstream reaches appears to have caused avulsions which have left behind the only large-scale, oxbow-type features on the Brazilian Amazon River floodplain.},

abstract = {Tropical forests play an important role as a reservoir of carbon and biodiversity, specifically forests in the Brazilian Amazon. However, the last decades have been marked by important changes in the Amazon, particularly those associated with climatic extremes. Quantifying the variability of rainfall patterns, hence, is essential for understanding changes and impacts of climate upon this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to analyse spatiotemporal trends in rainfall along the Brazilian Legal Amazon between 1998 and 2015. For this purpose, rainfall data derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite (TRMM) and nonparametric statistical methods, such as Mann-Kendall and Sen's Slope, were used. Through this approach, some patterns were identified. No evidence of significant rainfall trends (p ≤ 0.05) for annual or monthly (except for September, which showed a significant negative trend) averages was found. However, significant monthly negative rainfall anomalies were found in 1998, 2005, 2010, and 2015, and positive in 1999, 2000, 2004, 2009, and 2013. The annual pixel-by-pixel analysis showed that 92.3% of the Brazilian Amazon had no rainfall trend during the period analysed, 4.2% had significant negative trends (p ≤ 0.05), and another 3.5% had significant positive trends (p ≤ 0.05). Despite no clear temporal rainfall trends for most of the Amazon had negative trends for September, corresponding to the peak of dry season in the majority of the region, and negative rainfall anomalies found in 22% of the years analysed, which indicate that water-dependent ecological processes may be negatively affected. Moreover, these processes may be under increased risk of disruption resulting from other drought-related events, such as wildfires, which are expect to be intensified by rainfall reduction during the Amazonian dry season.},

abstract = {The availability of highly accessible and reliable monthly gridded data sets of global land-surface precipitation is a need that was already identified in the mid-1980s when there was a complete lack of globally homogeneous gauge-based precipitation analyses. Since 1989, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) has built up its unique capacity to assemble, quality assure, and analyse rain gauge data gathered from all over the world. The resulting database has exceeded 200 yr in temporal coverage and has acquired data from more than 85 000 stations worldwide. Based on this database, this paper provides the reference publication for the four globally gridded monthly precipitation products of the GPCC, covering a 111-yr analysis period from 1901&ndash;present. As required for a reference publication, the content of the product portfolio, as well as the underlying methodologies to process and interpolate are detailed. Moreover, we provide information on the systematic and statistical errors associated with the data products. Finally, sample applications provide potential users of GPCC data products with suitable advice on capabilities and constraints of the gridded data sets. In doing so, the capabilities to access El Ni{\~{n}}o&ndash;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) sensitive precipitation regions and to perform trend analyses across the past 110 yr are demonstrated. The four gridded products, i.e. the Climatology (CLIM) V2011, the Full Data Reanalysis (FD) V6, the Monitoring Product (MP) V4, and the First Guess Product (FG), are publicly available on easily accessible latitude/longitude grids encoded in zipped clear text ASCII files for subsequent visualization and download through the GPCC download gate hosted on ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/data/gpcc/html/download-gate.html by the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), Offenbach, Germany. Depending on the product, four (0.25°, 0.5°, 1.0°, 2.5° for CLIM), three (0.5°, 1.0°, 2.5°, for FD), two (1.0°, 2.5° for MP) or one (1.0° for FG) resolution is provided, and for each product a DOI reference is provided allowing for public user access to the products. A preliminary description of the scope of a fifth product &ndash; the Homogenized Precipitation Analysis (HOMPRA) &ndash; is also provided.

abstract = {Land surface waters play a primary role in the global water cycle and climate. As a consequence, there is a widespread demand for accurate and long-term quantitative observations of their distribution over the whole globe. This study presents the first global data set that quantifies the monthly distribution of surface water extent at ∼25 km sampling intervals over 12 years (1993-2004). These estimates, generated from complementary multiple-satellite observations, including passive (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) and active (ERS scatterometer) microwaves along with visible and near-infrared imagery (advanced very high-resolution radiometer; AVHRR), were first developed over 1993-2000. The ERS encountered technical problems in 2001 and the processing scheme had to be adapted to extend the time series. Here we investigate and discuss the adjustments of the methodology, compare the various options, and show that the data set can be extended with good confidence beyond 2000, using ERS and AVHRR mean monthly climatologies. In addition to a large seasonal and interannual variability, the new results show a slight overall decrease in global inundated area between 1993 and 2004, representing an ∼5.7% reduction of the mean annual maximum in 12 years. The decrease is mainly observed in the tropics during the 1990s. Over inland water bodies and large river basins, we assess the variability of the surface water extent against related variables such as in situ river discharges, altimeter-derived and in situ river/floodplain water level heights, and precipitation estimates. This new 12 year data set of global surface water extent represents an unprecedented source of information for future hydrological or methane modeling.

Here, we calculate local forest transpiration and the subsequent trajectories of transpired water through the atmosphere in high spatial and temporal detail. We estimate that one-third of Amazon rainfall originates within its own basin, of which two-thirds has been transpired. Forests in the southern half of the basin contribute most to the stability of other forests in this way, whereas forests in the south-western Amazon are particularly dependent on transpired-water subsidies. These forest-rainfall cascades buffer the effects of drought and reveal a mechanism by which deforestation can compromise the resilience of the Amazon forest system in the face of future climatic extremes.},

abstract = {The southern border of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the most sensitive areas to deforestation in Brazil. Pondering problems related to changes in land use, new issues are emerging, such as, climate change and its negative effects on the regional hydrological cycle. The higher frequency of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a seems to have strong influence on rainfall in Amazonia. They are becoming more lasting and intense in the course of the last 20 to 30 years compared to the past 100 years. This paper may confront the scientific knowledge of the relations of climate and water resources in Amazon with the points of vulnerability that anthropic societies present in the region. The impact of climate change is not uniformly borne by different regions and populations. Actually, individuals, sectors and systems are affected to varying degrees and, besides, they may be prejudiced to a greater or lesser extent. These impacts vary in magnitude and intensity in accordance with certain aspects, for instance, geographical location, time, the prevalent social, economic and environmental conditions and the infra-structure of a given location. A comprehensive description of these extreme climate events is one of the first steps to a regional vulnerability approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The Mann-Kendall test and a regression analysis were used to assess the direction and rate of change to both indices.

abstract = {Patterns of surface sediment concentration distribution in rivers are significant for understanding fluvial morphodynamics and environmental characteristics of the rivers and their floodplains. In the case of the Amazon Basin, complexity in sediment pattern distribution is affected by the anabranching channel pattern of the Amazon River, inputs from tributaries (some of which are among the largest rivers on Earth) and the existence of huge and complex floodplains. In this paper, patterns of surface sediment distribution are modeled based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over the Amazon River by estimating surface sediment concentrations. Specifically, we aim to 1) detect the regional and seasonal variability of surface sediment in the main channel, 2) observe the influence of tributaries into the main system, 3) identify channel-floodplain interactions, and 4) investigate the internal variability of surface sediment along the main channel system. Field surface sediment concentration data from three gauging stations representing the upstream, midstream, and downstream sections of the Amazon River between 2000 and 2010 were used to calibrate 1328 MODIS daily surface reflectance images. Robust empirical models were derived between field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data from each station (0.79<R2<0.92, slopes significant at 99% confidence level) from 752 selected data after quality control. We applied empirical models to 2112 8-day composite surface reflectance images to generate surface sediment distribution maps since 2000. Overall, this study successfully demonstrated the capability of our MODIS-based model to capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface sediments in the Amazon River Basin, the largest river system on Earth. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Based on nine years (1983-91) of infrared data from geostationary satellites (the B3 ISCCP product), several features of the diurnal march of the frequency of convective cloudiness over the tropical and subtropical Americas are documented with3-h temporal resolution and 0.5° × 0.5° latitude-longitude spatial resoluton. The frequency of convective cloudiness in each grid box is defined in terms of the fraction of temporal samples that exhibit cloud-top temperatures colder than 235 K. The effect of varying the threshold is explored and selected results are compared with rainfall estimates based on microwave (SSM/I) imagery. Convective cloudiness over most land areas exhibits a coherent diurnal march with relatively clear mornings, a rapid afternoon buildup, and a more gradual nighttime decay. The highest, coldest convective clouds peak a few hours earlier than those with lower tops. Morning to nootime maxtima tend to be prevalent over offshore waters that experience significant convection such as the Gulf of Panama, with the highest convective clouds leading the lower ones by 6 h or more. During the austral summer, the strongest diurnal march is observed over the Andes Mountains, in a band just inland of the northeast coast of South America and in two intermediate, parallel bands over Amazonia. Between these bands, weak night and morning maxima are observed in some areas. During the boreal summer the strongest diurnal march is observed over Central America and extending northwest along the continental divide as far as the southwestern United States. In comparison to the microwave imagery, the features in convective cloudiness tend to be somewhat larger in spatial scale, and cloudiness over land tends to be biased toward the late afternoon and evening hours. Regions with strong late afternoon/early evening maxima in vonvective cloudiness tend to experience more diurnal-mean convective cloudiness than those with weak (or morning) maxima. Although the evidence is less conclusive, it appears that the same may be true of rainfall. On the basis of these results it is suggested that over regions of relatively flat terrain such as Amazonia, the dynamics of the diurnal march may play a role in determining the spatial distribution of climatolgical-mean rainfall.},

abstract = {Climate change and its effects on the hydrologic regime of the Amazon basin can impact biogeochemical processes, transportation, flood vulnerability, fisheries and hydropower generation. We examined projections of climate change on discharge and inundation extent in the Amazon basin using the regional hydrological model MGB-IPH with 1-dimensional river hydraulic and water storage simulation in floodplains. Future projections (2070–2099) were obtained from five GCMs from IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report CMIP5. Climate projections have uncertainty and results from different climate models did not agree in total Amazon flooded area or discharge anomalies along the main stem river. Overall, model runs agree better with wetter (drier) conditions over western (eastern) Amazon. Results indicate that increased mean and maximum river discharge for large rivers draining the Andes in the northwest contributes to increased mean and maximum discharge and inundation extent over Peruvian floodplains and Solim{\~{o}}es River (annual mean-max: +9 % - +18.3 %) in western Amazonia. Decreased river discharges (mostly dry season) are projected for eastern basins, and decreased inundation extent at low water (annual min) in the central (−15.9 %) and lower Amazon (−4.4 %).},

Moisture flux, its divergence, and sources and sinks over the tropics of South and Central America and the adjoining Atlantic Ocean are obtained for dry years and for wet years in the Amazon Basin. Results show that the Amazon Basin is a sink region for atmospheric moisture in all seasons and that there are two source regions for the moisture in the basin, one situated in the South Atlantic and the other in the North Atlantic, both located equator-ward of the respective subtropical high-pressure centers. The convergence of moisture increases over the Amazon Basin in austral summer, and at the same time it decreases in the Pacific and Atlantic ITCZs. Box model calculations reveal that the wet years, on the average, present about 55 % more moisture convergence than the dry years in the Amazon Basin. A reduction in the moisture inflow across the eastern and northern boundaries of the basin (at 45°W and at the Equator, respectively) and an increase in the outflow across the southern boundary (at 15°S) lead to dry conditions. The annual mean contribution of moisture convergence to the precipitation over the Amazon Basin is estimated to be 70 %. In the dry years, it lowers to around 50 %. The net convergence of water vapor flux over the basin is a good indicator of the wet or dry condition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the spatial and temporal variability of winter droughts in a semi-arid geographic gradient in Northeast Spain, from the Pyrenees in the north to the Mediterranean coastland in the south. Droughts that occurred between 1952 and 1999 were analysed by means of the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The influence of the weather-type frequency and of the general North Atlantic atmospheric circulation patterns was analysed. The results indicate that winter droughts show an important spatial variability in the study area, differentiating three well-defined patterns. These correspond to the Pyrenees, the centre of the Ebro Valley, and the Mediterranean coastland. General negative trends in winter SPI have been found, which are indicative of the increase in winter drought conditions in the study area. Nevertheless, important spatial differences have also been recorded. Dominant north–south gradients in the influence of weather types are shown. Moreover, the negative trends in winter-SPI values agree with the negative trend in the frequency of the weather types prone to cause precipitation, such as the C, SW and W weather types and the increase in the frequency of A weather types. Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean coastland, the positive trend in SPI values agrees with the increase in the frequency of weather types of the east (E, SE), which are prone to cause precipitation in this area. Interannual variations in the frequency of the different weather types have been highly determined by different general atmospheric circulation patterns, mainly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Nevertheless, the correlation between the time series of weather-type frequency and the winter SPI is higher than that found between the SPI and the NAO. Thus, although the interannual NAO variability explains a high percentage of the interannual differences in the frequency of different weather types, it is not sufficient to explain the spatial and temporal variability of droughts, which respond better to atmospheric variability at more detailed (synoptic) spatial scales.},

abstract = {In the tropical Andes, the identification of the present synoptic mechanisms associated with the diurnal cycle of precipitation and its interaction with orography is a key step to understand how the atmospheric circulation influences the patterns of precipitation variability on longer time-scales. In particular we aim to better understand the combination of the local and regional mechanisms controlling the diurnal cycle of summertime (DJF) precipitation in the Northern Central Andes (NCA) region of Southern Peru. A climatology of the diurnal cycle is obtained from 15 wet seasons (2000–2014) of 3-hourly TRMM-3B42 data (0.25° × 0.25°) and swath data from the TRMM-2A25 precipitation radar product (5 km × 5 km). The main findings are: (1) in the NCA region, the diurnal cycle shows a maximum precipitation occurring during the day (night) in the western (eastern) side of the Andes highlands, (2) in the valleys of the Cuzco region and in the Amazon slope of the Andes the maximum (minimum) precipitation occurs during the night (day). The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) regional atmospheric model is used to simulate the mean diurnal cycle in the NCA region for the same period at 27 km and 9 km horizontal grid spacing and 3-hourly output, and at 3 km only for the month of January 2010 in the Cuzco valleys. Sensitivity experiments were also performed to investigate the effect of the topography on the observed rainfall patterns. The model reproduces the main diurnal precipitation features. The main atmospheric processes identified are: (1) the presence of a regional-scale cyclonic circulation strengthening during the afternoon, (2) diurnal thermally driven circulations at local scale, including upslope (downslope) wind and moisture transport during the day (night), (3) channelization of the upslope moisture transport from the Amazon along the Apurimac valleys toward the western part of the cordillera.},

Launched in March 2002, the two GRACE satellites have collected nearly two years of data. A span of data available during the Commissioning Phase was used to obtain initial gravity models. The gravity models developed with this data are more than an order of magnitude better at the long and mid wavelengths than previous models. The error estimates indicate a 2-cm accuracy uniformly over the land and ocean regions, a consequence of the highly accurate, global and homogenous nature of the GRACE data.

abstract = {The measurement of global precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, is critical to a wide range of users and applications. Rain gauges are indispensable in the measurement of precipitation, remaining the de facto standard for precipitation information across Earth's surface for hydrometeorological purposes. However, their distribution across the globe is limited: over land their distribution and density is variable, while over oceans very few gauges exist and where measurements are made, they may not adequately reflect the rainfall amounts of the broader area. Critically, the number of gauges available, or appropriate for a particular study, varies greatly across the Earth owing to temporal sampling resolutions, periods of operation, data latency, and data access. Numbers of gauges range from a few thousand available in near–real time to about 100,000 for all “official” gauges, and to possibly hundreds of thousands if all possible gauges are included. Gauges routinely used in the generation of global precipitation products cover an equivalent area of between about 250 and 3,000 m2. For comparison, the center circle of a soccer pitch or tennis court is about 260 m2. Although each gauge should represent more than just the gauge orifice, autocorrelation distances of precipitation vary greatly with regime and the integration period. Assuming each Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC)–available gauge is independent and represents a surrounding area of 5-km radius, this represents only about 1% of Earth's surface. The situation is further confounded for snowfall, which has a greater measurement uncertainty.},

abstract = {The hydrological effects of forest cover loss are difficult to discern in the case of large-scale basins with gradual changes and difficult to isolate when climate variability is also present. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of climate variability and human activity on the annual streamflow in a basin in the Amazon arc of deforestation. We statistically analyzed the components of the annual water balance and monthly streamflow and used the currently used Tomer-Schilling, elasticity, and decomposition of Budyko-type curve methods to separate climate-induced changes and anthropogenic effects. Annual series of the monthly maximum and minimum streamflow, total streamflow, and total reference evapotranspiration presented statistically significant increasing trends. No significant trend was observed for precipitation. The greatest change in the average annual runoff coefficient was observed between the first (1973–1984) and second (1985–1994) analyzed periods. Even with the continuous reduction in the forested area, the third (1994–2004) and fourth analyzed periods (2003–2016) showed only relatively small changes, most likely due to the intensity of slash-and-burn activities and vegetation regrowth. The methods showed that deforestation was the primary cause of the streamflow changes, but with different intensities, and a small recuperation was observed in the last analyzed period. On average, the annual water yield would increase between 26% and 58% after the first time interval without the opposite effect of climate variability, which must be considered in basin management. Future research should focus on analyzing the water storage and the dependence of the precipitation-runoff relationship from the climate.},

abstract = {The prominent Andes cordillera induces significant differences in climates between its eastern and western slopes. These climatic differences are largely reflected by contrasting vegetation and ice coverages but remain poorly documented. This study quantifies the abrupt changes of precipitation and cloud properties at both sides of the Andes south of 20°S by using surface daily precipitation and satellite (CloudSat and MODIS) data during the 2006-2016 period. Results show that the precipitation changes drastically and precipitating clouds can be of very different nature on each side of the Andes. In the tropical Andes (20-25°S), precipitation normally falls from a sole layer of thick stratiform and convective precipitating clouds during the warm semester, but the annual mean accumulation is about 10-100 times larger on the eastern than on the western slopes. A sole layer of low stratus clouds dominates over the Pacific coast, occasionally producing light rains, whereas high, thin, and non-precipitating clouds dominate most of the time over the continent. In the subtropical Andes (25-35°S), annual mean precipitation is similar on both sides, however, it falls from convective and stratiform precipitating clouds in the warm semester on the eastern slopes, and from stratiform precipitating clouds in the cold semester, mostly as frozen particles, on the western slopes. These different features on both slopes denote a climatic transition between the tropics and extratropics. In the extratropical Andes (south of 35°S), stratiform cloud types produces precipitation on both sides during all the year, but the annual mean precipitation and cloud frequency are enhanced on the western slopes and strongly reduced on the eastern slopes of the Andes. Cloud frequencies are higher than in the subtropics and evenly distributed as single- or multi-layers of low, middle and high clouds. Frozen particles become important in precipitating clouds over the mountains and on the lee side. These findings demonstrate the significant influence of the Andes cordillera on the climate all along southwestern South America, and constitute an excellent example of how the simple dependence of climate on latitude can be substantially altered by the topography.},

abstract = {Tropical rainforest regions have large hydropower generation potential that figures prominently in many nations' energy growth strategies. Feasibility studies of hydropower plants typically ignore the effect of future deforestation or assume that deforestation will have a positive effect on river discharge and energy generation resulting from declines in evapotranspiration (ET) associated with forest conversion. Forest loss can also reduce river discharge, however, by inhibiting rainfall. We used land use, hydrological, and climate models to examine the local "direct" effects (through changes in ET within the watershed) and the potential regional "indirect" effects (through changes in rainfall) of deforestation on river discharge and energy generation potential for the Belo Monte energy complex, one of the world's largest hydropower plants that is currently under construction on the Xingu River in the eastern Amazon. In the absence of indirect effects of deforestation, simulated deforestation of 20% and 40% within the Xingu River basin increased discharge by 4-8% and 10-12%, with similar increases in energy generation. When indirect effects were considered, deforestation of the Amazon region inhibited rainfall within the Xingu Basin, counterbalancing declines in ET and decreasing discharge by 6-36%. Under business-as-usual projections of forest loss for 2050 (40%), simulated power generation declined to only 25% of maximum plant output and 60% of the industry's own projections. Like other energy sources, hydropower plants present large social and environmental costs. Their reliability as energy sources, however, must take into account their dependence on forests.},

abstract = {Cirrus clouds determine the radiative balance of the upper troposphere and the transport of water vapor across the tropopause. The representation of vertical wind velocity, W, in atmospheric models constitutes the largest source of uncertainty in the calculation of the cirrus formation rate. Using global atmospheric simulations with a spatial resolution of 7 km we obtain for the first time a direct estimate of the distribution of W at the scale relevant for cirrus formation, validated against long-term observations at two different ground sites. The standard deviation in W, $\sigma$ w, varies widely over the globe with the highest values resulting from orographic uplift and convection, and the lowest occurring in the Arctic. Globally about 90% of the simulated $\sigma$ w values are below 0.1 m s-1 and about one in 104 cloud formation events occur in environments with $\sigma$ w > 0.8 m s-1. Combining our estimate with reanalysis products and an advanced cloud formation scheme results in lower homogeneous ice nucleation frequency than previously reported, and a decreasing average ice crystal concentration with decreasing temperature. These features are in agreement with observations and suggest that the correct parameterization of $\sigma$ w is critical to simulate realistic cirrus properties.},

Results showed satisfactory agreement between S-band SIPAM radar and both IMERG and GPROF2014 algorithms. However, during the wet season, IMERG, which uses the GPROF2014 rainfall retrieval from the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) sensor, significantly overestimates the frequency of heavy rainfall volumes around 00:00-04:00 UTC and 15:00-18:00 UTC. This overestimation is particularly evident over the Negro, Solim{\~{o}}es and Amazon rivers due to the poorly-calibrated algorithm over water surfaces. On the other hand, during the dry season, the IMERG product underestimates mean precipitation in comparison to the S-band SIPAM radar, mainly due to the fact that isolated convective rain cells in the afternoon are not detected by the satellite precipitation algorithm.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal variations of water volume over inundated areas located in a large river basin have been determined using combined observations from a multisatellite inundation data set, the TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) altimetry satellite, and in situ hydrographic stations for the water levels over rivers and floodplains. We computed maps of monthly surface water volume change over the period of common availability of T/P and the multisatellite data (1993-2000). The basin of the Negro River, the largest tributary in terms of discharge to the Amazon River, was selected as a test site. A strong seasonal signal is observed with minima in October and maxima in June. A strong interannual component is also present, particularly important during ENSO years. The surface water change was estimated to be 167 ± 39 km3 between October 1995 (low water) and June 1996 (high water). This result is consistent with previous estimates obtained for the 1995-1996 hydrological cycle over the same area using the JERS mosaic data. The surface water volume change is then compared to the total water volume change inferred from the GRACE satellite for an average annual cycle. The difference between the surface storage change and the total storage change derived from GRACE was computed to estimate the contribution of the soil moisture and groundwater to the total storage change. Our study supports the hypothesis that total water storage is almost equally partitioned between surface water and the combination of soil moisture and groundwater for the Negro River basin. The water volume changes are also evaluated using in situ discharge measurements and the GPCP precipitation product (correlation of 0.61).

abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of the ORCHIDEE land surface model to simulate streamflows over each sub-basin of the Amazon River basin. For this purpose, simulations are performed with a routing module including the influence of floodplains and swamps on river discharge and validated against on-site hydrological measurements collected within the HYBAM observatory over the 1980-2000 period. When forced by the NCC global meteorological dataset, the initial version of ORCHIDEE shows discrepancies with ORE HYBAM measurements with underestimation by 15% of the annual mean streamflow at {\'{O}}bidos hydrological station. Consequently, several improvements are incrementally added to the initial simulation in order to reduce those discrepancies. First, values of NCC precipitation are substituted by ORE HYBAM daily in-situ rainfall observations from the meteorological services of Amazonian countries, interpolated over the basin. It highly improves the simulated streamflow over the northern and western parts of the basin, whereas streamflow over southern regions becomes overestimated, probably due to the extension of rainy spots that may be exaggerated by our interpolation method, or to an underestimation of simulated evapotranspiration when compared to flux tower measurements. Second, the initial map of maximal fractions of floodplains and swamps which largely underestimates floodplains areas over the main stem of the Amazon River and over the region of Llanos de Moxos in Bolivia, is substituted by a new one with a better agreement with different estimates over the basin. Simulated monthly water height is consequently better represented in ORCHIDEE when compared to Topex/Poseidon measurements over the main stem of the Amazon. Finally, a calibration of the time constant of the floodplain reservoir is performed to adjust the mean simulated seasonal peak flow at {\'{O}}bidos in agreement with the observations.},

abstract = {Study region: Upper Madeira Basin (975,500 km2) in Southern Amazonia, which is suffering a biophysical transition, involving deforestation and changes in rainfall regime. Study focus: The evolution of the runoff coefficient (Rc: runoff/rainfall) is examined as an indicator of the environmental changes (1982–2017). New hydrological insights for the region: At an annual scale, the Rc at Porto Velho station declines while neither the basin-averaged rainfall nor the runoff change. During the low-water period Rc and runoff diminish while no changes are observed in rainfall. This cannot be explained by increase of evapotranspiration since the basin-averaged actual evapotranspiration decreases. To explain the decrease of Rc, a regional analysis is undertaken. While the characteristic rainfall-runoff time-lag (CT) at Porto Velho basin is estimated to 60 days, CT is higher (65–75 days) in the south and lower (50 days) over the Amazon-Andes transition regions. It is found that 1) the southern basin (south of 14 °S) best explains low-level Porto Velho runoff, 2) in the south, rainfall diminishes and the frequency of dry days increases. Both features explain the diminution of the runoff and the Rc in Porto Velho. Moreover, the increasing dryness in the south compensates for the rainfall and frequency of wet days (>10 mm) increase north of 14 °S and explains the lack of basin-averaged rainfall trends of the upper Madeira basin.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017. The Authors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the data sources and estimation methods of 30 currently available global precipitation data sets, including gauge-based, satellite-related, and reanalysis data sets. We analyzed the discrepancies between the data sets from daily to annual timescales and found large differences in both the magnitude and the variability of precipitation estimates. The magnitude of annual precipitation estimates over global land deviated by as much as 300 mm/yr among the products. Reanalysis data sets had a larger degree of variability than the other types of data sets. The degree of variability in precipitation estimates also varied by region. Large differences in annual and seasonal estimates were found in tropical oceans, complex mountain areas, northern Africa, and some high-latitude regions. Overall, the variability associated with extreme precipitation estimates was slightly greater at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes. The reliability of precipitation data sets is mainly limited by the number and spatial coverage of surface stations, the satellite algorithms, and the data assimilation models. The inconsistencies described limit the capability of the products for climate monitoring, attribution, and model validation.},

Thus, overall the monthly temperature climate has not become more extreme. Midtwentieth century including the 1930s was an earlier period of frequent very warm months, a result of very warm daytime temperatures, while nighttime temperatures were not unusual. Regionally, there is a lack of century-scale warming in the southeast U.S. annually and in parts of the central U.S. in the summer, characterized by lack of daytime warming while there has been nighttime warming. Compared to the earlier midcentury warm period, recent decades have been more (less) extreme in the summer (winter) in the west while Midwest summers have been less extreme.},

abstract = {Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data are used to indicate mechanisms responsible for extreme summer convection over South America. The three-dimensional reflectivity field is analyzed to define three types of extreme echo, deep convective cores, wide convective cores, and broad stratiform regions. The location and timing of these echoes are sensitive to midlatitude synoptic disturbances crossing the Andes. At the leading edges of these disturbances the nocturnal South American low-level jet (SALLJ) transports moisture along the eastern edge of the Andes from the tropical to the subtropical part of the continent. Where the SALLJ rises over lower but steep mountains on the east side of the southern central Andes, deep and wide convective cores are triggered in the evening. When the SALLJ withdraws to the north as the disturbance passes, nocturnal triggering occurs in the northeastern foothills of the central Andes. Extreme convection over the Amazon basin takes the form of broad stratiform regions that evolve from systems with wide convective cores moving into the center of the region from both the southwest and northeast. The systems from the northeast form at the northeast coast and are likely squall lines. Along the coast of the Brazilian Highlands, diurnal/topographic forcing leads to daytime maxima of deep convective cores followed a few hours later by wide convective cores. Wide convective cores and broad stratiform regions form in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) with a diurnal cycle related to continental heating. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

With a finer grid box of 0.1°, these products should provide more detailed information than their latest widely-adapted (relatively coarser spatial scale, 0.25°) counterpart. Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation version 6 (GSMaP-v6) assessment is done by comparing their rainfall estimations with 247 rainfall gauges from 2014 to 2016 in Bolivia. The comparisons were done on annual, monthly and daily temporal scales over the three main national watersheds (Amazon, La Plata and TDPS), for both wet and dry seasons to assess the seasonal variability and according to different slope classes to assess the topographic influence on SREs. To observe the potential enhancement in rainfall estimates brought by these two recently released products, the widely-used TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product is also considered in the analysis. The performances of all the products increase during the wet season. Slightly less accurate than TMPA, IMERG can almost achieve its main objective, which is to ensure TMPA rainfall measurements, while enhancing the discretization of rainy and non-rainy days. It also provides the most accurate estimates among all products over the Altiplano arid region. GSMaP-v6 is the least accurate product over the region and tends to underestimate rainfall over the Amazon and La Plata regions. Over the Amazon and La Plata region, SRE potentiality is related to topographic features with the highest bias observed over high slope regions. Over the TDPS watershed, the high rainfall spatial variability with marked wet and arid regions is the main factor influencing SREs.},

abstract = {On the Tibetan Plateau, the limited ground-based rainfall information owing to a harsh environment has brought great challenges to hydrological studies. Satellite-based rainfall products, which allow for a better coverage than both radar network and rain gauges on the Tibetan Plateau, can be suitable alternatives for studies on investigating the hydrological processes and climate change. In this study, a newly developed daily satellite-based precipitation product, termed Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), is used as input for a hydrologic model to simulate streamflow in the upper Yellow and Yangtze River basins on the Tibetan Plateau. The results show that the simulated streamflows using PERSIANN-CDR precipitation and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) precipitation are closer to observation than that using limited gauge-based precipitation interpolation in the upper Yangtze River basin. The simulated streamflow using gauge-based precipitation are higher than the streamflow observation during the wet season. In the upper Yellow River basin, gauge-based precipitation, GLDAS precipitation, and PERSIANN-CDR precipitation have similar good performance in simulating streamflow. The evaluation of streamflow simulation capability in this study partly indicates that the PERSIANN-CDR rainfall product has good potential to be a reliable dataset and an alternative information source of a limited gauge network for conducting long-term hydrological and climate studies on the Tibetan Plateau.},

Daily rainfall estimates are generated for an 18-year long period (1998-2015), with a spatial sampling of 0.25° on a global scale, and are based on the integration of the ACTIVE and the PASSIVE ESA CCI SM data sets.The quality of the SM2RAIN-CCI rainfall data set is evaluated by comparing it with two state-of-the-art rainfall satellite products, i.e. the Tropical Measurement Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42 real-time product (TMPA 3B42RT) and the Climate Prediction Center Morphing Technique (CMORPH), and one modeled data set (ERA-Interim). A quality check is carried out on a global scale at 1° of spatial sampling and 5 days of temporal sampling by comparing these products with the gauge-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre Full Data Daily (GPCC-FDD) product. SM2RAIN-CCI shows relatively good results in terms of correlation coefficient (median value > 0.56), root mean square difference (RMSD, median value < 10.34mm over 5 days) and bias (median value < 14.44%) during the evaluation period.

abstract = {A Kalman filter (KF)-based Climate Prediction Center (CPC) morphing technique (CMORPH) algorithm is developed to integrate the passive microwave (PMW) precipitation estimates from low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and infrared (IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) platforms. With the new algorithm, the precipitation analysis at a grid box of 8 × 8 km 2 is defined in three steps. First, PMW estimates of instantaneous rain rates closest to the target analysis time in both the forward and backward directions are propagated from their observation times to the analysis time using the cloud system advection vectors (CSAVs) computed from the GEO-IR images. The "prediction" of the precipitation analysis is then defined by averaging the forward- and backward-propagated PMW estimates with weights inversely proportional to their error variance. The IR-based precipitation estimates are incorporated if the gap between the two PMW observations is longer than 90 min. Validation tests showed substantial improvements of the KF-based CMORPH against the original version in both the pattern correlation and fidelity of probability density function (PDF) of the precipitation intensity. In general, performance of the original CMORPH degrades sharply with poor pattern correlation and substantially elevated (damped) frequency for light (heavy) precipitation events when PMW precipitation estimates are available from fewer LEO satellites. The KF-based CMORPHis capable of producing high-resolution precipitation analysis with much more stable performance with various levels of availability for the PMW observations. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a new set of equations derived from 1D shallow water theory for use in 2D storage cell inundation models where flows in the x and y Cartesian directions are decoupled. The new equation set is designed to be solved explicitly at very low computational cost, and is here tested against a suite of four test cases of increasing complexity. In each case the predicted water depths compare favourably to analytical solutions or to simulation results from the diffusive storage cell code of Hunter et al. (2005). For the most complex test involving the fine spatial resolution simulation of flow in a topographically complex urban area the Root Mean Squared Difference between the new formulation and the model of Hunter et al. is $\sim$1cm. However, unlike diffusive storage cell codes where the stable time step scales with (1/$\Delta$x)2, the new equation set developed here represents shallow water wave propagation and so the stability is controlled by the Courant-Freidrichs-Lewy condition such that the stable time step instead scales with 1/$\Delta$x. This allows use of a stable time step that is 1-3 orders of magnitude greater for typical cell sizes than that possible with diffusive storage cell models and results in commensurate reductions in model run times. For the tests reported in this paper the maximum speed up achieved over a diffusive storage cell model was 1120×, although the actual value seen will depend on model resolution and water surface gradient. Solutions using the new equation set are shown to be grid-independent for the conditions considered and to have an intuitively correct sensitivity to friction, however small instabilities and increased errors on predicted depth were noted when Manning's n=0.01. The new equations are likely to find widespread application in many types of flood inundation modelling and should provide a useful additional tool, alongside more established model formulations, for a variety of flood risk management studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Surface and atmospheric water balances analysis for Amazon River basin at monthly time scale are performed with an emphasis on the linkages between the Andes and low-lying Amazonia. Analyses are performed using observational and reanalysis data covering five different periods of analysis (depending on length of evapotranspiration data sets) for the entire basin, major subcatchments, and for the Andes and low-lying Amazonia. Results for the entire basin show a state close to balance within tolerance, while the spatial disaggregation produced a less clear picture, presenting major discrepancies between observations and reanalysis data sets. The atmospheric budget exhibits no closure and positive residuals regardless of data set, with the magnitude of residuals for the entire Amazon basin highly dependent on evapotranspiration data source. The imbalance between the two water budgets (14%–16%) is driven by higher values of runoff and by an abrupt change in runoff when changing from dry to wet seasons in the Amazon. We unveil two shortcomings of the available data, namely poor quality in the representation of surface processes by reanalysis, and flaws and scarcity of information in the high Andes that induce uncertainties and errors in both water budgets. The results of the present study highlight the importance of the Andean region for the hydrological integrity of the entire Amazon River basin. Our results confirm the paramount importance of the joint analysis of atmospheric and surface water budgets at the basin level with respect to achieving a complete understanding of the whole hydrological cycle at the continental scale.},

abstract = {[Nimbus 7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) measurements at five frequencies in the region 6.6 to 37 GHz, at a resolution of 155 km, are analyzed to infer precipitation over the global oceans. The microwave data show, on this spatial scale, that the combined liquid water in the clouds and rain increases the brightness temperature almost linearly with frequency in the 6.6 to 18 GHz region, while at 37 GHz such a simple relationship is not noticed. Further, as the atmospheric water vapor absorption and the effects of scattering by precipitation particles are relatively weak at 6.6 and 10.7 GHz, a technique to remotely sense the liquid water content in the atmosphere is developed based on the brightness measurements at these two frequencies. Seasonal mean patterns of liquid water content in the atmosphere derived from SMMR over global oceans relate closely to climatological patterns of precipitation. Based on this, an empirical relationship is derived to estimate precipitation over the global oceans, with an accuracy of about ±30 percent, on a seasonal basis from satellite measurements made during the three years (1979–81) before the recent El Ni{\~{n}}o event. The deviations from these three-year means, in the precipitation, produced by the 1982–83 El Ni{\~{n}}o event are then deduced from the SMMR measurements. In the Pacific one notices from these deviations that the precipitation over the ITCZ in the north, the South Pacific Convergence Zone, and the oceans around Indonesia is drastically reduced. At the same time a substantial increase in precipitation is observed over the normally dry central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.]},

abstract = {In this study, a satellite-derived precipitation "climatology" (climate description) over northern South America using a passive microwave technique, the Goddard Profiling algorithm, is presented. The results are statistically adjusted to have the same probability distribution as a rain gauge dataset. The climatologies take the form of the mean estimated rainfall for a 10-yr+ period, with subdivisions by month and meteorological season. For the 6-yr period 1992-97, when two satellites were in operation, diurnal variability (to the extent it is discerned by four unequally spaced observations) is presented. In the mean, dramatic patterns of alternating morning and evening maxima are seen stretching from the northeast (Atlantic coast) across the continent to the Pacific. The effects of local circulations caused by topography, coastlines, and geography (river valleys) on the rainfall patterns are evident, particularly in the region around Manaus, Brazil, where the Negro and Solimoes Rivers merge. The interannual variability of the 10-yr rainfall estimate is examined by computing the deviations of yearly and warm-season (December-February) rainfall from their respective long-term means. Rainfall anomalies associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events then become apparent. This gauge-adjusted satellite climatology enhances existing (gauge based) climatologies by increasing the spatial resolution and providing a common, spaceborne platform for assessing interannual variability. It maintains the same first- and second-order statistics as does the gauge dataset, and allows a first attempt at examining the diurnal cycles by utilizing passive microwave observations (up to) four times per day.},

abstract = {A new retrospective satellite-based precipitation dataset is constructed as a climate data record for hydrological and climate studies. Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) provides daily and 0.25° rainfall estimates for the latitude band 60°S-60°N for the period of 1 January 1983 to 31 December 2012 (delayed present). PERSIANN-CDR is aimed at addressing the need for a consistent, long-term, high-resolution, and global precipitation dataset for studying the changes and trends in daily precipitation, especially extreme precipitation events, due to climate change and natural variability. PERSIANN-CDR is generated from the PERSIANN algorithm using GridSat-B1 infrared data. It is adjusted using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly product to maintain consistency of the two datasets at 2.5° monthly scale throughout the entire record. Three case studies for testing the efficacy of the dataset against available observations and satellite products are reported. The verification study over Hurricane Katrina (2005) shows that PERSIANN-CDR has good agreement with the stage IV radar data, noting that PERSIANN-CDR has more complete spatial coverage than the radar data. In addition, the comparison of PERSIANN-CDR against gauge observations during the 1986 Sydney flood in Australia reaffirms the capability of PERSIANN-CDR to provide reasonably accurate rainfall estimates. Moreover, the probability density function (PDF) of PERSIANN-CDR over the contiguous United States exhibits good agreement with the PDFs of the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gridded gauge data and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product. The results indicate high potential for using PERSIANN-CDR for long-term hydroclimate studies in regional and global scales.},

abstract = {Water siltation caused by artisanal gold mining has impacted the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River Basin in Brazil for the past 40. years, however spatial-temporal information about changes in water quality and consequences to the aquatic environment is lacking. To address this, the Landsat satellite family sensors were used to retrieve total suspended solids (TSS) of the water of the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River from 1973 to 2013. An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed.},

abstract = {Reduced rainfall increases the risk of forest dieback, while in return forest loss might intensify regional droughts. The consequences of this vegetation-atmosphere feedback for the stability of the Amazon forest are still unclear. Here we show that the risk of self-amplified Amazon forest loss increases nonlinearly with dry-season intensification. We apply a novel complex-network approach, in which Amazon forest patches are linked by observation-based atmospheric water fluxes. Our results suggest that the risk of self-amplified forest loss is reduced with increasing heterogeneity in the response of forest patches to reduced rainfall. Under dry-season Amazonian rainfall reductions, comparable to Last Glacial Maximum conditions, additional forest loss due to self-amplified effects occurs in 10-13% of the Amazon basin. Although our findings do not indicate that the projected rainfall changes for the end of the twenty-first century will lead to complete Amazon dieback, they suggest that frequent extreme drought events have the potential to destabilize large parts of the Amazon forest.},

abstract = {New precipitation (P) datasets are released regularly, following innovations in weather forecasting models, satellite retrieval methods, and multi-source merging techniques. Using the conterminous US as a case study, we evaluated the performance of 26 gridded (sub-)daily P datasets to obtain insight into the merit of these innovations. The evaluation was performed at a daily timescale for the period 2008-2017 using the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), a performance metric combining correlation, bias, and variability. As a reference, we used the high-resolution (4 km) Stage-IV gauge-radar P dataset. Among the three KGE components, the P datasets performed worst overall in terms of correlation (related to event identification). In terms of improving KGE scores for these datasets, improved P totals (affecting the bias score) and improved distribution of P intensity (affecting the variability score) are of secondary importance. Among the 11 gauge-corrected P datasets, the best overall performance was obtained by MSWEP V2.2, underscoring the importance of applying daily gauge corrections and accounting for gauge reporting times. Several uncorrected P datasets outperformed gauge-corrected ones. Among the 15 uncorrected P datasets, the best performance was obtained by the ERA5-HRES fourth-generation reanalysis, reflecting the significant advances in earth system modeling during the last decade. The (re)analyses generally performed better in winter than in summer, while the opposite was the case for the satellite-based datasets. IMERGHH V05 performed substantially better than TMPA-3B42RT V7, attributable to the many improvements implemented in the IMERG satellite P retrieval algorithm. IMERGHH V05 outperformed ERA5-HRES in regions dominated by convective storms, while the opposite was observed in regions of complex terrain. The ERA5-EDA ensemble average exhibited higher correlations than the ERA5-HRES deterministic run, highlighting the value of ensemble modeling. The WRF regional convectionpermitting climate model showed considerably more accurate P totals over the mountainous west and performed best among the uncorrected datasets in terms of variability, suggesting there is merit in using high-resolution models to obtain climatological P statistics. Our findings provide some guidance to choose the most suitable P dataset for a particular application.},

abstract = {The Andes is the longest cordillera in the world and extends from northern South America to the southern extreme of the continent (from 11°N to 53°S). The Andes runs through seven countries and is characterized by a wide variety of ecosystems strongly related to the contrasting climate over its eastern and western sides, as well as along its latitudinal extension. This region faces very high potential impacts of climate change, which could affect food and water security for about 90 million people. In addition, climate change represents an important threat on biodiversity, particularly in the tropical Andes, which is the most biodiverse region on Earth. From a scientific and societal view, the Andes exhibits specific challenges because of its unique landscape and the fragile equilibrium between the growing population and its environment. In this manuscript, we provide an updated review of the most relevant scientific literature regarding the hydroclimate of the Andes with an integrated view of the entire Andes range. This review paper is presented in two parts. Part I is dedicated to summarize the scientific knowledge about the main climatic features of the Andes, with emphasis on mean large-scale atmospheric circulation, the Andes-Amazon hydroclimate interconnections and the most distinctive diurnal and annual cycles of precipitation. Part II, which is also included in the research topic “Connecting Mountain Hydroclimate Through the American Cordilleras,” focuses on the hydroclimate variability of the Andes at the sub-continental scale, including the effects of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation.},

abstract = {The impacts of droughts on the Amazon ecosystem have been broadly discussed in recent years, but a comprehensive understanding of the consequences is still missing. In this study, we show evidence of a fragile hydrological equilibrium in the western Amazon. While drainage systems located near the equator and the western Amazon do not show water deficit in years with average climate conditions, this equilibrium can be broken during drought events. More importantly, we show that this effect is persistent, taking years until the normal hydrological patterns are reestablished. We show clear links between persistent changes in forest canopy structure and changes in hydrological patterns, revealing physical evidence of hydrological mechanisms that may lead to permanent changes in parts of the Amazon ecosystem. If prospects of increasing drought frequency are confirmed, a change in the current hydroecological patterns in the western Amazon could take place in less than a decade.},

abstract = {Climate change and its effects on the hydrologic regime of the Amazon basin can impact biogeochemical processes, transportation, flood vulnerability, fisheries and hydropower generation. We examined projections of climate change on discharge and inundation extent in the Amazon basin using the regional hydrological model MGB-IPH with 1-dimensional river hydraulic and water storage simulation in floodplains. Future projections (2070–2099) were obtained from five GCMs from IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report CMIP5. Climate projections have uncertainty and results from different climate models did not agree in total Amazon flooded area or discharge anomalies along the main stem river. Overall, model runs agree better with wetter (drier) conditions over western (eastern) Amazon. Results indicate that increased mean and maximum river discharge for large rivers draining the Andes in the northwest contributes to increased mean and maximum discharge and inundation extent over Peruvian floodplains and Solim{\~{o}}es River (annual mean-max: +9 % - +18.3 %) in western Amazonia. Decreased river discharges (mostly dry season) are projected for eastern basins, and decreased inundation extent at low water (annual min) in the central (−15.9 %) and lower Amazon (−4.4 %).},

abstract = {Large dams built for hydroelectric power generation alter the hydrology of rivers, attenuating the flood pulse downstream of the dam and impacting riparian and floodplain ecosystems. The present work mapped black-water floodplain forests (igap{\'{o}}) downstream of the Balbina Reservoir, which was created between 1983 and 1987 by damming the Uatum{\~{a}} River in the Central Amazon basin. We apply remote sensing methods to detect tree mortality resulting from hydrological changes, based on analysis of 56 ALOS/PALSAR synthetic aperture radar images acquired at different flood levels between 2006 and 2011. Our application of object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods and the random forests supervised classification algorithm yielded an overall accuracy of 87.2%. A total of 9800 km 2 of igap{\'{o}} forests were mapped along the entire river downstream of the dam, but forest mortality was only observed below the first 49 km downstream, after the Morena rapids, along an 80-km river stretch. In total, 12% of the floodplain forest died within this stretch. We also detected that 29% of the remaining living igap{\'{o}} forest may be presently undergoing mortality. Furthermore, this large loss does not include the entirety of lost igap{\'{o}} forests downstream of the dam; areas which are now above current maximum flooding heights are no longer floodable and do not show on our mapping but will likely transition over time to upland forest species composition and dynamics, also characteristic of igap{\'{o}} loss. Our results show that floodplain forests are extremely sensitive to long-term downstream hydrological changes and disturbances resulting from the disruption of the natural flood pulse. Brazilian hydropower regulations should require that Amazon dam operations ensure the simulation of the natural flood-pulse, despite losses in energy production, to preserve the integrity of floodplain forest ecosystems and to mitigate impacts for the riverine populations.},

abstract = {The precipitation that falls on the continents defines the extent and nature of terrestrial ecosystems and human activity in them, all of which are adapted to and maintained by present-day precipitation. In essence, precipitation is supplied by moisture that either comes directly from the ocean, or is subsequently recycled from the continents themselves. Both the processes that control evaporation and the main mechanisms of moisture transport clearly differ between the ocean and the continent, thus within the context of a changing climate, it may be expected that the relationship between precipitation of oceanic and terrestrial origin varies globally and regionally, as will the influence of these two basic components of total precipitation on global and regional precipitation trends, especially in tropical regions. We describe an approach based on a Lagrangian technique for estimating the precipitation in a target region given the proportions of moisture transported from the two sources (ocean and continent) to reveal that the percentage of precipitation of oceanic origin has increased globally in the current climate (1980–2016). The greatest observed rate of increase is in the tropical regions; furthermore, the trends of precipitation in these regions are controlled by trends in precipitation for which the source of moisture is the ocean.},

The recycling rate is a diagnostic measure of the potential for interactions between land surface hydrology and regional climate. In this paper we present a model for describing the seasonal and spatial variability of the recycling process. The precipitation recycling ratio, $\rho$, is the basic variable in describing the recycling process, $\rho$ is the fraction of precipitation at a certain location and time which is contributed by evaporation within the region under study. The recycling model is applied in studying the hydrologic cycle in the Amazon basin. It is estimated that about 25% of all the rain that falls in the Amazon basin is contributed by evaporation within the basin. This estimate is based on analysis of a data set supplied by the European Centre for Medium‐range Weather Forecasts. The same analysis is repeated using a different data set from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Based on this data set, the recycling ratio is estimated to be 35%. The seasonal variability of the recycling ratio is small compared with the yearly average. The new estimates of the recycling ratio are compared with results of previous studies, and the differences are explained. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1994 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {Tropical river basins are experiencing major hydrological alterations as a result of climate variability and deforestation. These drivers of flow changes are often difficult to isolate in large basins based on either observations or experiments; however, combining these methods with numerical models can help identify the contribution of climate and deforestation to hydrological alterations. This paper presents a study carried out in the Tapajόs River (Brazil), a 477,000 km2 basin in South-eastern Amazonia, in which we analysed the role of annual land cover change on daily river flows. Analysis of observed spatial and temporal trends in rainfall, forest cover, and river flow metrics for 1976 to 2008 indicates a significant shortening of the wet season and reduction in river flows through most of the basin despite no significant trend in annual precipitation. Coincident with seasonal trends over the past 4 decades, over 35% of the original forest (140,000 out of 400,000 km2) was cleared. In order to determine the effects of land clearing and rainfall variability to trends in river flows, we conducted hindcast simulations with ED2 + R, a terrestrial biosphere model incorporating fine scale ecosystem heterogeneity arising from annual land-use change and linked to a flow routing scheme. The simulations indicated basin-wide increases in dry season flows caused by land cover transitions beginning in the early 1990s when forest cover dropped to 80% of its original extent. Simulations of historical potential vegetation in the absence of land cover transitions indicate that reduction in rainfall during the dry season (mean of −9 mm per month) would have had an opposite and larger magnitude effect than deforestation (maximum of +4 mm/month), leading to the overall net negative trend in river flows. In light of the expected increase in future climate variability and water infrastructure development in the Amazon and other tropical basins, this study presents an approach for analysing how multiple drivers of change are altering regional hydrology and water resources management.},

abstract = {Global precipitation variations over the satellite era are reviewed using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly, globally complete analyses, which integrate satellite and surface gauge information. Mean planetary values are examined and compared, over ocean, with information from recent satellite programs and related estimates, with generally positive agreements, but with some indication of small underestimates for GPCP over the global ocean. Variations during the satellite era in global precipitation are tied to ENSO events, with small increases during El Ninos, and very noticeable decreases after major volcanic eruptions. No overall significant trend is noted in the global precipitation mean value, unlike that for surface temperature and atmospheric water vapor. However, there is a pattern of positive and negative trends across the planet with increases over tropical oceans and decreases over some middle latitude regions. These observed patterns are a result of a combination of inter-decadal variations and the effect of the global warming during the period. The results reviewed here indicate the value of such analyses as GPCP and the possible improvement in the information as the record lengthens and as new, more sophisticated and more accurate observations are included.},

abstract = {The CIRSAN/LBA field campaign was conducted close to two major rivers of the Amazon Basin, the Tapaj{\'{o}}s and the Amazon. The observations indicate that during weak trade wind episodes the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River breeze actually induces a westerly flow at the eastern margin with an associated line of shallow cumulus. The atmospheric circulation induced by the river has been interpreted with the help of a high resolution numerical simulation. A single cell forms during late morning over the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River and evolves into the afternoon with ascending motion in the eastern margin and a descending branch in the western margin suppressing cloud formation. During the night, convergence is seen along the centre of the River Tapaj{\'{o}}s. The implications of the particular geometry of the river with respect to the trade winds for the generalization of the surface measurements of turbulent fluxes of heat, moisture and CO2 in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s eastern margin of the Amazon Basin as a whole are discussed. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {The precipitation variability over the eastern Amazon (EAM) and northeast Brazil (NEB) during the autumn rainy season (March to May) is diagnosed using raingauge-based weekly data from 1982 to 2001. Since precipitation in this region is remarkably modulated by the combined effects of the Pacific and Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies, two extreme and contrasting large-scale climatic scenarios are considered in this study. The unfavorable (UNFAV) scenario, defined by the simultaneous occurrences of the El Ni{\~{n}}o and northward SST gradient in the intertropical Atlantic and the favorable (FAV) scenario, by the simultaneous occurrence of the La Ni{\~{n}}a and southward SST gradient in the intertropical Atlantic. UNFAV (FAV) composites with unfiltered data show remarkable changes in both the Walker and the Hadley cells associated with the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) anomalously weakened (enhanced) thus with deficient (abundant) seasonal rainfall in most of the EAM/NEB. Precipitation variability is identified objectively through EOF analyses performed on the (30-70 day) intraseasonal and submonthly (≥21 day) filtered weekly precipitation anomalies for 18 autumn seasons (1983 to 2000). The principal components (PC) of the first mode of each analysis show strong oscillations. In particular, the oscillations of the PC series during UNFAV and FAV years reveal that events with anomalously deficient and abundant precipitation over the EAM/NEB occur alternately, even under extreme climatic conditions in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic. Composites based on events with anomalously increased precipitation (objectively selected from the PC series) on intraseasonal and submonthly scales are analyzed separately for the UNFAV and FAV years. These analyses show that for both scenarios the more important rainfall-producing atmospheric mechanism over the EAM/NEB on intraseasonal time scales consists of the establishment of deep convective bands trigged by South Atlantic Convergence Zone events or persistent frontal systems over northeast Brazil. Such a regional pattern is embedded in a large-scale dynamic environment related to the propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation over tropical South America. On the other hand, the main rainfall-producing atmospheric mechanism over the EAM/NEB on submonthly time scales is the Atlantic ITCZ during FAV years, whilst weakened Atlantic ITCZ activity may be forced by meridionally elongated mid-latitude wave trains in the upper troposphere during UNFAV years. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag/Wien 2005.},

abstract = {Satellite radar altimetry has the ability to monitor variations in surface water height (stage) for large wetlands, rivers, and associated floodplains. A clear advantage is the provision of data where traditional gauges are absent. As part of an international program, a complete altimetric analysis of the Amazon Basin is being undertaken. Here, an updated and more rigorous evaluation of the TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) data set is presented for the first ∼7.5 years of the mission. With an initial study group of 230 targets, height variability at many ungauged locations can be observed for 30-50%, the range reflecting the clarity of the variations in lieu of instrument limitations. An assessment of the instrument performance confirms that the minimum river width attainable is ∼1 km in the presence of some inundated floodplain. This constraint does allow observation of the main stem (Solim{\~{o}}es/Amazon) and the larger tributaries, but rugged terrain in the vicinity of the target additionally places severe limitations on data retrieval. First-order validation exercises with the deduced 1992-1999 time series of stage fluctuations reveal accuracies ranging from tens of centimeters to several meters (mean ∼1.1 m rms). Altimetric water levels in the Solim{\~{o}}es and Amazon are particularly well defined with amplitudes <13 m and variations in peak-level timing from May to July. The water-surface gradient of the main stem is found to vary both spatially and temporally, with values ranging from 1.5 cm/km downstream to 4.0 cm/km for more upstream reaches. In agreement with ground-based estimates, the seasonal variability of the gradients reveals that the hysteresis characteristic of the flood wave varies along the main stem and the derived altimetric velocity of this flood wave is estimated to be ∼0.35 m/s. Overall, the altimetric results demonstrate that the T/P mission is successfully monitoring the transient flood waves of this continental-scale river basin.

abstract = {We discuss the claim that the Amazon River has been subjected to a noticeable increase in suspended sediment transport (SST) in response to both climate and land-use changes. To study this, both satellite imagery and in situ data were compiled to produce a 32-year time series (1984–2016) of suspended sediment concentration. Both parametric and nonparametric statistics were applied to examine the SST time trend. The results indicate that there has been no statistically significant increase in SST in the last 32 years, independent of the statistical approach. The results indicate that, over the last 32 years at the {\'{O}}bidos station, in Brazil, a recurring pattern of increase and decrease in SST has occurred, rather than a unidirectional systematic trend. This further explains the increasing trend reported in the literature and indicates that short time series are not recommended for time trend analyses due to the large inter-annual variability.},

abstract = {An initial ground validation of the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Day-1 product from March 2014 to August 2015 is presented for the tropical Andes. IMERG was evaluated along with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) against 302 quality-controlled rain gauges across Ecuador and Peru. Detection, quantitative estimation statistics, and probability distribution functions are calculated at different spatial (0.1°, 0.25°) and temporal (1 h, 3 h, daily) scales. Precipitation products are analyzed for hydrometeorologically distinct subregions. Results show that IMERG has a superior detection and quantitative rainfall intensity estimation ability than TMPA, particularly in the high Andes. Despite slightly weaker agreement of mean rainfall fields, IMERG shows better characterization of gauge observations when separating rainfall detection and rainfall rate estimation. At corresponding space-time scales, IMERG shows better estimation of gauge rainfall probability distributions than TMPA. However, IMERG shows no improvement in both rainfall detection and rainfall rate estimation along the dry Peruvian coastline, where major random and systematic errors persist. Further research is required to identify which rainfall intensities are missed or falsely detected and how errors can be attributed to specific satellite sensor retrievals. The satellite-gauge difference was associated with the point-area difference in spatial support between gauges and satellite precipitation products, particularly in areas with low and irregular gauge network coverage. Future satellite-gauge evaluations need to identify such locations and investigate more closely interpixel point-area differences before attributing uncertainties to satellite products.},

abstract = {Information on the vertical structure of rain, especially near the surface is important for accurate quantitative precipitation estimation from weather and space-borne radars. In the present study, the rainfall characteristics, from a vertically pointed profile Radar in the Mantaro basin (Huancayo, Peru) are observed. In summary, diurnal variation of near-surface rainfall and bright band height, average vertical profiles of the drop size distribution (DSD), rain rate, radar reflectivity (Ze) and liquid water content (LWC) are investigated to derive the rainfall characteristics. Diurnal variation of rain rate and bright band height show the bimodal distribution, where frequent and higher rain rate occurred during the afternoon and nighttime, and more than 70% bright band height found between 4.3-4.7 km. The average vertical profiles of Ze show the opposite characteristics above and below the melting level (ML) and depend on the near-surface rain rate. For example, the average Ze profiles have a negative gradient above the ML, whereas below, the ML, the gradient depends on the near-surface rain rate. The rain rate and LWC show the opposite behavior, and both consist of a positive (negative) gradient below (above) the ML. The vertical growth of DSD parameters depend on the near-surface rain rate, and a higher concentration of large-sized of droplets are observed for higher near surface rain rate, however, the dominant modes of droplets are <1 mm throughout the vertical column. However, the most significant variation in DSD growth is observed for near-surface rain rate ≥20 mm/h. These findings suggest using different retrieval techniques for near surface rain estimation than the rest of the vertical profile and high rain rate events. The improved understanding of the tropical Andes precipitation would be very important for assessing climate variability and to forecast the precipitation using the numerical models.},

abstract = {Thermal infrared (IR) radiances measured near 8 microns contain information about the vertical distribution of water vapor (H 2O), the water isotopologue HDO, and methane (CH 4), key gases in the water and carbon cycles. Previous versions (Version 4 or less) of the TES profile retrieval algorithm used a "spectral-window" approach to minimize uncertainty from interfering species at the expense of reduced vertical resolution and sensitivity. In this manuscript we document changes to the vertical resolution and uncertainties of the TES version 5 retrieval algorithm. In this version (Version 5), joint estimates of H 2O, HDO, CH 4 and nitrous oxide (N 2O) are made using radiances from almost the entire spectral region between 1100 cmg -1 and 1330 cmg -1. The TES retrieval constraints are also modified in order to better use this information. The new H 2O estimates show improved vertical resolution in the lower troposphere and boundary layer, while the new HDO/H 2O estimates can now profile the HDO/H 2O ratio between 925 hPa and 450 hPa in the tropics and during summertime at high latitudes. The new retrievals are now sensitive to methane in the free troposphere between 800 and 150 mb with peak sensitivity near 500 hPa; whereas in previous versions the sensitivity peaked at 200 hPa. However, the upper troposphere methane concentrations are biased high relative to the lower troposphere by approximately 4% on average. This bias is likely related to temperature, calibration, and/or methane spectroscopy errors. This bias can be mitigated by normalizing the CH 4 estimate by the ratio of the N 2O estimate relative to the N 2O prior, under the assumption that the same systematic error affects both the N 2O and CH 4 estimates. We demonstrate that applying this ratio theoretically reduces the CH 4 estimate for non-retrieved parameters that jointly affect both the N 2O and CH 4 estimates. The relative upper troposphere to lower troposphere bias is approximately 2.8% after this bias correction. Quality flags based upon the vertical variability of the methane and N 2O estimates can be used to reduce this bias further. While these new CH 4, HDO/H 2O, and H 2O estimates are consistent with previous TES retrievals in the altitude regions where the sensitivities overlap, future comparisons with independent profile measurement will be required to characterize the biases of these new retrievals and determine if the calculated uncertainties using the new constraints are consistent with actual uncertainties. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

abstract = {Due to progressive erosion of the new Urucurituba Channel, the Amazon River has recently captured almost all discharge from the lower Araguari River (Amap{\'{a}}-AP, Brazil), which previously flowed directly to the Atlantic Ocean. These recent geomorphological changes have caused strong impacts on the landscape and hydrodynamic patterns near the Araguari River mouth, especially the alteration of the riverine drainage system and its water quality. Landsat images were used to assess the estuarine landscape morphodynamic, particularly the expansion of the Urucurituba Channel, 80 km from the Araguari River mouth, chronicling its connection to the Amazon River. The results suggest that the Urucurituba developed by headward migration across the Amazon delta; this is perhaps the first observation of estuarine distributary network development by headward channel erosion. The rate of Urucurituba Channel width increase has been ≈ 5 m/month since 2011, increasing drainage capacity of the channel. We also collected in situ hydrodynamic measurements and analyzed 17 water quality parameters. Having 2011 as baseline, the flowrate of Araguari River has been diverted by up to 98% through Urucurituba Channel, with substantial changes in net discharge recorded at 3 monitoring stations. Statistically significant differences in water quality (p < 0.05) were observed between 2011 and 2015, associated with the change in the flow pattern. Estuarine salinity and solids concentrations have increased. Overall, we demonstrate changes in landscape, hydrodynamics and water quality of the lower Araguari River.},

abstract = {This review surveys current and emerging drought monitoring approaches using satellite remote sensing observations from climatological and ecosystem perspectives. We argue that satellite observations not currently used for operational drought monitoring, such as near-surface air relative humidity data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder mission, provide opportunities to improve early drought warning. Current and future satellite missions offer opportunities to develop composite and multi-indicator drought models. While there are immense opportunities, there are major challenges including data continuity, unquantified uncertainty, sensor changes, and community acceptability. One of the major limitations of many of the currently available satellite observations is their short length of record. A number of relevant satellite missions and sensors (e.g., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) provide only a decade of data, which may not be sufficient to study droughts from a climate perspective. However, they still provide valuable information about relevant hydrologic and ecological processes linked to this natural hazard. Therefore, there is a need for models and algorithms that combine multiple data sets and/or assimilate satellite observations into model simulations to generate long-term climate data records. Finally, the study identifies a major gap in indicators for describing drought impacts on the carbon and nitrogen cycle, which are fundamental to assessing drought impacts on ecosystems.},

MERRA-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, MERRA, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond MERRA's terminus. While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015.

abstract = {The Amazon basin hosts half the planet's remaining moist tropical forests, but they may be threatened in a warming world. Nevertheless, climate model predictions vary from rapid drying to modest wetting. Here we report that the catchment of the world's largest river is experiencing a substantial wetting trend since approximately 1990. This intensification of the hydrological cycle is concentrated overwhelmingly in the wet season driving progressively greater differences in Amazon peak and minimum flows. The onset of the trend coincides with the onset of an upward trend in tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). This positive longer-term correlation contrasts with the short-term, negative response of basin- wide precipitation to positive anomalies in tropical North Atlantic SST, which are driven by temporary shifts in the intertropical convergence zone position. We propose that the Amazon precipitation changes since 1990 are instead related to increasing atmospheric water vapor import from the warming tropical Atlantic},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission provides time-variable gravity fields that are commonly used to study regional and global terrestrial total water storage (TWS) changes. These estimates are superimposed by different error sources such as the north–south stripes in the spatial domain and spectral/spatial leakage errors, which should be reduced before use in hydrological applications. Although different filtering methods have been developed to mitigate these errors, their performances are known to vary between regions. In this study, a Kernel Fourier Integration (KeFIn) filter is proposed, which can significantly decrease leakage errors over (small) river basins through a two-step post-processing algorithm. The first step mitigates the measurement noise and the aliasing of unmodelled high-frequency mass variations, and the second step contains an efficient kernel to decrease the leakage errors. To evaluate its performance, the KeFIn filter is compared with commonly used filters based on (i) basin/gridded scaling factors and (ii) ordinary basin averaging kernels. Two test scenarios are considered that include synthetic data with properties similar to GRACE TWS estimates within 43 globally distributed river basins of various sizes and application of the filters on real GRACE data. The KeFIn filter is assessed against water flux observations through the water balance equations as well as in-situ measurements. Results of both tests indicate a remarkable improvement after applying the KeFIn filter with leakage errors reduced in 34 out of the 43 assessed river basins and an average improvement of about 23.38% in leakage error reduction compared to other filters applied in this study.},

abstract = {The rainfall characteristics over the Brazilian Amazon were analysed using 3 yr of 3 h data from 24 rain gauges. During this period, areas in the eastern sector experienced up to 22 % of rainy hours, while those in the southern sector recorded up to 7 %. In the northern Amazon, rain tends to occur during the night, while in southern, central and central-western Amazon it occurs mainly in the afternoon. In contrast, over the eastern Amazon, rain occurs late at night and early in the morning. Harmonic analysis revealed an increase in the phase of the first harmonic phase from eastern towards central Amazon, suggesting that the rain propagates in that direction. The amplitude of the first and second harmonics revealed the existence of a relatively dry area inland about 500 km from the Atlantic coast. This area seems to be the limit for the inland penetration of systems originating at the coast. The phase of the first harmonic revealed small differences between the diurnal cycles of rainfall during the wet and dry seasons, suggesting that there is no difference between low-level circulations in either season. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2003.},

abstract = {Closing the terrestrial water budget is necessary to provide consistent estimates of budget components for understanding water resources and changes over time. Given the lack of in situ observations of budget components at anything but local scale, merging information from multiple data sources (e.g., in situ observation, satellite remote sensing, land surface model, and reanalysis) through data assimilation techniques that optimize the estimation of fluxes is a promising approach. Conditioned on the current limited data availability, a systematic method is developed to optimally combine multiple available data sources for precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and the total water storage change (TWSC) at 0.5 degrees spatial resolution globally and to obtain water budget closure (i.e., to enforce P - ET - R - TWSC = 0) through a constrained Kalman filter (CKF) data assimilation technique under the assumption that the deviation from the ensemble mean of all data sources for the same budget variable is used as a proxy of the uncertainty in individual water budget variables. The resulting long-term (1984-2010), monthly 0.5 degrees resolution global terrestrial water cycle Climate Data Record (CDR) data set is developed under the auspices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) program. This data set serves to bridge the gap between sparsely gauged regions and the regions with sufficient in situ observations in investigating the temporal and spatial variability in the terrestrial hydrology at multiple scales. The CDR created in this study is validated against in situ measurements like river discharge from the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and ET from FLUXNET. The data set is shown to be reliable and can serve the scientific community in understanding historical climate variability in water cycle fluxes and stores, benchmarking the current climate, and validating models.},

abstract = {In the central Amazon, surrounding Manaus City, Brazil, the landscape dominated by forest and water bodies supports development of river breezes. Seasonal inundations modify this local scenery affecting, consequently, the local circulations. However, this effect has not properly been investigated yet. Thus, we carried out numerical experiments for a river breeze case to investigate the seasonal flooding effect on the river breeze and detail the processes involved in the river breeze development. In the numerical experiments, we ran the Catchment-Based Macro-scale Floodplain (CaMa-Flood) model to simulate flooding depth and extent and used the CaMa-Flood outputs to force the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model. The seasonal flooding alters the surface energy partitioning causing a temperature decrease over the river region and intensification of the river breezes in the daytime. The intensified river breezes propagate more rapidly through the upland region, take longer to dissipate and promote stronger upward vertical motion altering the heat and mass transport. These novel findings are fundamentally important to the understanding of the local climate variability of the central Amazon. We can infer that river breezes and its consequence to local climate are less (more) pronounced in drought (wet) years.},

abstract = {The Andes is the longest cordillera in the world and extends from northern South America to the southern extreme of the continent (from 11°N to 53°S). The Andes runs through seven countries and is characterized by a wide variety of ecosystems strongly related to the contrasting climate over its eastern and western sides, as well as along its latitudinal extension. This region faces very high potential impacts of climate change, which could affect food and water security for about 90 million people. In addition, climate change represents an important threat on biodiversity, particularly in the tropical Andes, which is the most biodiverse region on Earth. From a scientific and societal view, the Andes exhibits specific challenges because of its unique landscape and the fragile equilibrium between the growing population and its environment. In this manuscript, we provide an updated review of the most relevant scientific literature regarding the hydroclimate of the Andes with an integrated view of the entire Andes range. This review paper is presented in two parts. Part I is dedicated to summarize the scientific knowledge about the main climatic features of the Andes, with emphasis on mean large-scale atmospheric circulation, the Andes-Amazon hydroclimate interconnections and the most distinctive diurnal and annual cycles of precipitation. Part II, which is also included in the research topic “Connecting Mountain Hydroclimate Through the American Cordilleras,” focuses on the hydroclimate variability of the Andes at the sub-continental scale, including the effects of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation.},

abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67% to 77%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

abstract = {The climatological structure in the upper-tropospheric summertime circulation over South America is diagnosed using a GCM (with and without South American topography), a linear model, and observational data. Emphasis is placed on understanding the origin of observed features such as the Bolivian high and the accompanying "Nordeste low" to the east. Results from the linear model indicate that these two features are generated in response to precipitation over the Amazon basin, central Andes, and South Atlantic convergence zone, with African precipitation also playing a crucial role in the formation of the Nordeste low. The direct mechanical and sensible heating effects of the Andes are minimal, acting only to induce a weak lee trough in midlatitudes and a shallow monsoonal circulation over the central Andes. In the GCM, the effects of the Andes include a strengthening of the Bolivian high and northward shift of the Nordeste low, primarily through changes in the precipitation field. The position of the Bolivian high is primarily determined by Amazonian precipitation and is little affected by the removal of the Andes. Strong subsidence to the west of the high is found to be important for the maintenance of the high's warm core, while large-scale convective overshooting to the east is responsible for a layer of cold air above the high.},

abstract = {Large-scale hydrological models are nowadays mostly calibrated using observed discharge. As a result, a large part of the hydrological system, in particular the unsaturated zone, remains uncalibrated. Soil moisture observations from satellites have the potential to fill this gap. Here we evaluate the added value of remotely sensed soil moisture in calibration of large-scale hydrological models by addressing two research questions: (1) Which parameters of hydrological models can be identified by calibration with remotely sensed soil moisture? (2) Does calibration with remotely sensed soil moisture lead to an improved calibration of hydrological models compared to calibration based only on discharge observations, such that this leads to improved simulations of soil moisture content and discharge? A dual state and parameter Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to calibrate the hydrological model LISFLOOD for the Upper Danube. Calibration is done using discharge and remotely sensed soil moisture acquired by AMSR-E, SMOS, and ASCAT. Calibration with discharge data improves the estimation of groundwater and routing parameters. Calibration with only remotely sensed soil moisture results in an accurate identification of parameters related to land-surface processes. For the Upper Danube upstream area up to 40,000 km2, calibration on both discharge and soil moisture results in a reduction by 10–30% in the RMSE for discharge simulations, compared to calibration on discharge alone. The conclusion is that remotely sensed soil moisture holds potential for calibration of hydrological models, leading to a better simulation of soil moisture content throughout the catchment and a better simulation of discharge in upstream areas.},

The analyses focus on the dominant mechanisms that modulate terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations and droughts. We find that (1) the model simulates the basin-averaged TWS variations remarkably well; however, disagreements are observed in spatial patterns of temporal trends, especially for the post-2008 period. (2) The 2010s is the driest period since 1980, characterized by a major shift in the decadal mean compared to the 2000s caused by increased drought frequency. (3) Long-term trends in TWS suggest that the Amazon overall is getting wetter (1.13 mm yr-1), but its southern and southeastern sub-basins are undergoing significant negative TWS changes, caused primarily by intensified LULC changes. (4) Increasing divergence between dry-season total water deficit and TWS release suggests a strengthening dry season, especially in the southern and southeastern sub-basins. (5) The sub-surface storage regulates the propagation of meteorological droughts into hydrological droughts by strongly modulating TWS release with respect to its storage preceding the drought condition. Our simulations provide crucial insight into the importance of sub-surface storage in alleviating surface water deficit across Amazon and open pathways for improving prediction and mitigation of extreme droughts under changing climate and increasing hydrologic alterations due to human activities (e.g., LULC change).},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall are governed by complex interactions between climate and landscape perturbations including deforestation, fire, and drought. Previous research demonstrated that rainfall in portions of the Amazon Basin has intensified, resulting in more extreme droughts and floods. The basin has global impacts on climate and hydrologic cycles; thus, it is critical to understand how precipitation patterns and intensity are changing. Due to insufficient precipitation gauges, we analyzed the variability and seasonality of rainfall over the Amazon Basin from 1982 to 2018 using high-resolution gridded precipitation products. We developed several precipitation indices and analyzed their trends using the Mann–Kendall test (Mann 1945; Kendall, 1975) to identify significant changes in rainfall patterns over time and space. Our results show landscape scale changes in the timing and intensity of rainfall events. Specifically, wet areas of the western Basin have become significantly wetter since 1982, with an increase of 182 mm of rainfall per year. In the eastern and southern regions, where deforestation is widespread, a significant drying trend is evident. Additionally, local alterations to precipitation patterns were also observed. For example, the Tocantins region has had a significant increase in the number of dry days during both wet and dry seasons, increasing by about 1 day per year. Surprisingly, changes in rainfall amount and number of dry days do not consistently align. Broadly, over this 37-year period, wet areas are trending wetter and dry areas are trending drier, while spatial anomalies show structure at the scale of hundreds of kilometers.},

abstract = {Abstract Historically, conservation-oriented research and policy in Brazil have focused on Amazon deforestation, but a majority of Brazil's deforestation and agricultural expansion has occurred in the neighboring Cerrado biome, a biodiversity hotspot comprised of dry forests, woodland savannas, and grasslands. Resilience of rainfed agriculture in both biomes likely depends on water recycling in undisturbed Cerrado vegetation; yet little is known about how changes in land-use and land-cover affect regional climate feedbacks in the Cerrado. We used remote sensing techniques to map land-use change across the Cerrado from 2003 to 2013. During this period, cropland agriculture more than doubled in area from 1.2 to 2.5 million ha, with 74% of new croplands sourced from previously intact Cerrado vegetation. We find that these changes have decreased the amount of water recycled to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration (ET) each year. In 2013 alone, cropland areas recycled 14 km3 less (?3%) water than if the land cover had been native Cerrado vegetation. ET from single-cropping systems (e.g., soybeans) is less than from natural vegetation in all years, except in the months of January and February, the height of the growing season. In double-cropping systems (e.g., soybeans followed by corn), ET is similar to or greater than natural vegetation throughout a majority of the wet season (December?May). As intensification and extensification of agricultural production continue in the region, the impacts on the water cycle and opportunities for mitigation warrant consideration. For example, if an environmental goal is to minimize impacts on the water cycle, double cropping (intensification) might be emphasized over extensification to maintain a landscape that behaves more akin to the natural system.},

abstract = {We investigated the seasonal patterns of water vapor and sensible heat flux along a tropical biome gradient from forest to savanna. We analyzed data from a network of flux towers in Brazil that were operated within the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). These tower sites included tropical humid and semideciduous forest, transitional forest, floodplain (with physiognomies of cerrado), and cerrado sensu stricto. The mean annual sensible heat flux at all sites ranged from 20 to 38 Wm-2, and was generally reduced in the wet season and increased in the late dry season, coincident with seasonal variations of net radiation and soil moisture. The sites were easily divisible into two functional groups based on the seasonality of evaporation: tropical forest and savanna. At sites with an annual precipitation above 1900 mm and a dry season length less than 4 months (Manaus, Santar{\'{e}}m and Rondonia), evaporation rates increased in the dry season, coincident with increased radiation. Evaporation rates were as high as 4.0 mm d-1 in these evergreen or semidecidous forests. In contrast, ecosystems with precipitation less than 1700 mm and a longer dry season (Mato Grosso, Tocantins and S{\~{a}}o Paulo) showed clear evidence of reduced evaporation in the dry season. Evaporation rates were as low as 2.5 mm d-1 in the transitional forests and 1 mm d-1 in the cerrado. The controls on evapotranspiration seasonality changed along the biome gradient, with evaporative demand (especially net radiation) playing a more important role in the wetter forests, and soil moisture playing a more important role in the drier savannah sites.

abstract = {We present a characterization of convective activity at sub-regional scale from two sets of satellite-based microwave observations: the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the combined Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) microwave imager and precipitation radar data, for the period 2001 to 2011. We focus on the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, located at the southern edge of the so-called "Legal Amazon" which has undergone intense land cover transformation in the last 4 decades. The annual cycle of mean convective activity described by AMSU and TRMM are in good agreement, with a correlation close to 0.80. The mean amplitude of convective activity is maximal early in the rainy season, except for AMSU deep convective area, which presents a maximum in January. The diurnal cycle of convection was examined for the period 2003 to 2007, and it was found that convection is maximal near 1500 local time (LT) and minimal around 0700 LT. Unlike the amplitude, the phase shows little intraseasonal and interannual variability. A slight decrease in convective activity in the studied period was found, possibly indicating an extension of the dry season. Comparisons of convective activity between deforested and forested areas showed no significant differences in the phase of the diurnal cycle, but our analysis shows a tendency for increase (decrease) in convection in deforested (forested) areas for the period considered. A longer time series is however necessary in order to strengthen the robustness of our results. {\textcopyright} 2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

First, the purely satellite-based CMORPH precipitation estimates (raw CMORPH) are reprocessed. The integration algorithm is fixed and the input level 2 passive microwave (PMW) retrievals of instantaneous precipitation rates are from identical versions throughout the entire data period. Bias correction is then performed for the raw CMORPH through probability density function (PDF) matching against the CPC daily gauge analysis over land and through adjustment against the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) pentad merged analysis of precipitation over ocean. The reprocessed, bias-corrected CMORPH exhibits improved performance in representing the magnitude, spatial distribution patterns, and temporal variations of precipitation over the global domain from 60°S to 60°N. Bias in the CMORPH satellite precipitation estimates is almost completely removed over land during warm seasons (May-September), while during cold seasons (October-April) CMORPH tends to underestimate the precipitation due to the less-than-desirable performance of the current-generation PMW retrievals in detecting and quantifying snowfall and cold season rainfall. An intercomparison study indicated that the reprocessed, bias-corrected CMORPH exhibits consistently superior performance than the widely used TRMM 3B42 (TMPA) in representing both daily and 3-hourly precipitation over the contiguous United States and other global regions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a description, sensitivity analyses, sample results, validation, and the recent progress done on the development of a new satellite rainfall estimation technique in the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The technique, called the auto-estimator, runs in real time for applications to flash flood forecasting, numerical modeling, operational hydrology. The auto-estimator uses the Geoestationary Operational Environmental Satellite-8 and -9 in the infrared (IR) 10.7-$\mu$m band to compute real-time precipitation amounts based on a power-law regression algorithm. This regression is derived from a statistical analysis between surface radar-derived instantaneous rainfall estimates and satellite-derived IR cloudtop temperatures collocated in time and space. The rainfall rate estimates are adjusted for different moisture regimes using the most recent fields of precipitable water and relative humidity generated by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Eta Model. In addition, a mask is computed to restrict rain to regions satisfying two criteria: (a) the growth rate of the cloud as a function of the temperature change of the cloud tops in two consecutive IR images must be positive, and (b) the spatial gradients of the cloud-top temperature field must show distinct and isolated cold cores in the cloud-top surface. Both the growth rate and the gradient corrections are useful for locating heavy precipitation cores. The auto-estimator has been used experimentally for almost 3 yr to provide real-time instantaneous rainfall rate estimates, average hourly estimates, and 3-, 6-, and 24-h accumulations over the conterminous 48 United States and nearby ocean areas. The NOAA/NESDIS Satellite Analyses Branch (SAB) has examined the accuracy of the rainfall estimates daily for a variety of storm systems. They have determined that the algorithm produces useful 1-6-h estimates for flash flood monitoring but exaggerates the area of precipitation causing overestimation of 24-h rainfall total associated with slow-moving, cold-topped mesoscale convective systems. The SAB analyses have also shown a tendency for underestimation of rainfall rates in warm-top stratiform cloud systems. Until further improvements, the use of this technique for stratiform events should be considered with caution. The authors validate the hourly rainfall rates of the auto-estimator using gauge-adjusted radar precipitation products (with radar bias removed) in three distinct cases. Results show that the auto-estimator has modest skill at 1-h time resolution for a spatial resolution of 12 km. Results improve with larger grid sizes (48 by 48 km or larger).},

Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) provides daily and 0.25° rainfall estimates for the latitude band 60°S-60°N for the period of 1 January 1983 to 31 December 2012 (delayed present). PERSIANN-CDR is aimed at addressing the need for a consistent, long-term, high-resolution, and global precipitation dataset for studying the changes and trends in daily precipitation, especially extreme precipitation events, due to climate change and natural variability. PERSIANN-CDR is generated from the PERSIANN algorithm using GridSat-B1 infrared data. It is adjusted using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly product to maintain consistency of the two datasets at 2.5° monthly scale throughout the entire record. Three case studies for testing the efficacy of the dataset against available observations and satellite products are reported. The verification study over Hurricane Katrina (2005) shows that PERSIANN-CDR has good agreement with the stage IV radar data, noting that PERSIANN-CDR has more complete spatial coverage than the radar data. In addition, the comparison of PERSIANN-CDR against gauge observations during the 1986 Sydney flood in Australia reaffirms the capability of PERSIANN-CDR to provide reasonably accurate rainfall estimates. Moreover, the probability density function (PDF) of PERSIANN-CDR over the contiguous United States exhibits good agreement with the PDFs of the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gridded gauge data and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product. The results indicate high potential for using PERSIANN-CDR for long-term hydroclimate studies in regional and global scales.},

This novel approach analyzes climate extreme events over the past four decades (1980–2016) using multiple gridded observation and reanalysis datasets. Furthermore, future changes in climate extremes are analyzed from 20 downscaled Earth System Models (ESMs) at high horizontal resolution (0.25° of latitude/longitude), under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Projected changes in the extreme indices are analyzed over mid-twenty-first century (2046–2065) and end-of-twenty-first century (2081–2100) relative to the reference period 1986–2005. Results show consistent warming patterns with increasing (decreasing) trends in warm (cold) extremes in the historical datasets. A similar but more intense warm pattern is projected in the mid and end of the twenty-first century. For precipitation indices, observations show an increase in consecutive dry days and a reduction of consecutive wet days over almost all Brazil. The frequency and intensity of extremely wet days over Brazil are expected to increase according to future scenarios. Designing effective adaptation and mitigation measures in response to changes in climate extremes events depends on this improved understanding of how conditions have and are likely to change in the future at regional scales.},

abstract = {An initial ground validation of the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Day-1 product from March 2014 to August 2015 is presented for the tropical Andes. IMERG was evaluated along with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) against 302 quality-controlled rain gauges across Ecuador and Peru. Detection, quantitative estimation statistics, and probability distribution functions are calculated at different spatial (0.1°, 0.25°) and temporal (1 h, 3 h, daily) scales. Precipitation products are analyzed for hydrometeorologically distinct subregions. Results show that IMERG has a superior detection and quantitative rainfall intensity estimation ability than TMPA, particularly in the high Andes. Despite slightly weaker agreement of mean rainfall fields, IMERG shows better characterization of gauge observations when separating rainfall detection and rainfall rate estimation. At corresponding space-time scales, IMERG shows better estimation of gauge rainfall probability distributions than TMPA. However, IMERG shows no improvement in both rainfall detection and rainfall rate estimation along the dry Peruvian coastline, where major random and systematic errors persist. Further research is required to identify which rainfall intensities are missed or falsely detected and how errors can be attributed to specific satellite sensor retrievals. The satellite-gauge difference was associated with the point-area difference in spatial support between gauges and satellite precipitation products, particularly in areas with low and irregular gauge network coverage. Future satellite-gauge evaluations need to identify such locations and investigate more closely interpixel point-area differences before attributing uncertainties to satellite products.},

Recent findings No new imaging modalities have been introduced in the last decade. However, new advances and improvements within the known modalities are constantly being presented and tested. Such advances include the use of contrast material and sonoelastography in the ultrasound evaluation of enthesitis, hybridization of PET imaging with computed tomography and MRI for the evaluation of the axial and peripheral skeleton, as well as advances within MRI such as whole-body MRI and diffusion-weighted sequences. These techniques will be presented and their advantages and disadvantages will be critically discussed. Summary Promising new techniques in the field of SpA imaging are constantly emerging.

abstract = {The availability of highly accessible and reliable monthly gridded data sets of global land-surface precipitation is a need that was already identified in the mid-1980s when there was a complete lack of globally homogeneous gauge-based precipitation analyses. Since 1989, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) has built up its unique capacity to assemble, quality assure, and analyse rain gauge data gathered from all over the world. The resulting database has exceeded 200 yr in temporal coverage and has acquired data from more than 85 000 stations worldwide. Based on this database, this paper provides the reference publication for the four globally gridded monthly precipitation products of the GPCC, covering a 111-yr analysis period from 1901&ndash;present. As required for a reference publication, the content of the product portfolio, as well as the underlying methodologies to process and interpolate are detailed. Moreover, we provide information on the systematic and statistical errors associated with the data products. Finally, sample applications provide potential users of GPCC data products with suitable advice on capabilities and constraints of the gridded data sets. In doing so, the capabilities to access El Ni{\~{n}}o&ndash;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) sensitive precipitation regions and to perform trend analyses across the past 110 yr are demonstrated. The four gridded products, i.e. the Climatology (CLIM) V2011, the Full Data Reanalysis (FD) V6, the Monitoring Product (MP) V4, and the First Guess Product (FG), are publicly available on easily accessible latitude/longitude grids encoded in zipped clear text ASCII files for subsequent visualization and download through the GPCC download gate hosted on ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/data/gpcc/html/download-gate.html by the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), Offenbach, Germany. Depending on the product, four (0.25°, 0.5°, 1.0°, 2.5° for CLIM), three (0.5°, 1.0°, 2.5°, for FD), two (1.0°, 2.5° for MP) or one (1.0° for FG) resolution is provided, and for each product a DOI reference is provided allowing for public user access to the products. A preliminary description of the scope of a fifth product &ndash; the Homogenized Precipitation Analysis (HOMPRA) &ndash; is also provided.

abstract = {Recent retrievals of multiple satellite products for each component of the terrestrial water cycle provide an opportunity to estimate the water budget globally. In this study, we estimate the water budget from satellite remote sensing over ten global river basins for 2003-2006. We use several satellite and non-satellite precipitation (P) and evapo-transpiration (ET) products in this study. The satellite precipitation products are the GPCP, TRMM, CMORPH and PERSIANN. For ET, we use four products generated from three retrieval models (Penman-Monteith (PM), Priestley-Taylor (PT) and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS)) with data inputs from the Earth Observing System (EOS) or the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) products. GPCP precipitation and PM (ISCCP) ET have less bias and errors over most of the river basins. To estimate the total water budget from satellite data for each basin, we generate merged products for P and ET by combining the four P and four ET products using weighted values based on their errors with respect to non-satellite merged product. The water storage change component is taken from GRACE satellite data, which are used directly with a single pre-specified error value. In the absence of satellite retrievals of river discharge, we use in-situ gauge measurements. Closure of the water budget over the river basins from the combined satellite and in-situ discharge products is not achievable with errors of the order of 5-25% of mean annual precipitation. A constrained ensemble Kalman filter is used to close the water budget and provide a constrained best-estimate of the water budget. The non-closure error from each water budget component is estimated and it is found that the merged satellite precipitation product carries most of the non-closure error. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is a set of algorithms dedicated to the estimation of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture from satellite data. Ever since its development in 2011, the model has been regularly revised, aiming at the optimal incorporation of new satellite-observed geophysical variables, and improving the representation of physical processes. In this study, the next version of this model (v3) is presented. Key changes relative to the previous version include (1) a revised formulation of the evaporative stress, (2) an optimized drainage algorithm, and (3) a new soil moisture data assimilation system. GLEAM v3 is used to produce three new data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture, including a 36-year data set spanning 1980-2015, referred to as v3a (based on satellite-observed soil moisture, vegetation optical depth and snow-water equivalent, reanalysis air temperature and radiation, and a multi-source precipitation product), and two satellite-based data sets. The latter share most of their forcing, except for the vegetation optical depth and soil moisture, which are based on observations from different passive and active C- and L-band microwave sensors (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative, ESA CCI) for the v3b data set (spanning 2003-2015) and observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite in the v3c data set (spanning 2011-2015). Here, these three data sets are described in detail, compared against analogous data sets generated using the previous version of GLEAM (v2), and validated against measurements from 91 eddy-covariance towers and 2325 soil moisture sensors across a broad range of ecosystems. Results indicate that the quality of the v3 soil moisture is consistently better than the one from v2: Average correlations against in situ surface soil moisture measurements increase from 0.61 to 0.64 in the case of the v3a data set and the representation of soil moisture in the second layer improves as well, with correlations increasing from 0.47 to 0.53. Similar improvements are observed for the v3b and c data sets. Despite regional differences, the quality of the evaporation fluxes remains overall similar to the one obtained using the previous version of GLEAM, with average correlations against eddy-covariance measurements ranging between 0.78 and 0.81 for the different data sets. These global data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture are now openly available at www.GLEAM.eu and may be used for large-scale hydrological applications, climate studies, or research on land-atmosphere feedbacks.},

abstract = {Purpose of review The role of imaging in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) has become dramatically more important with the introduction of new therapies such as tumor necrosis factor-a inhibitors. In the current review, contemporary perspectives on developments and advancements in the field of SpA imaging along with several novel imaging techniques for the diagnosis and follow-up of SpA will be discussed. Recent findings No new imaging modalities have been introduced in the last decade. However, new advances and improvements within the known modalities are constantly being presented and tested. Such advances include the use of contrast material and sonoelastography in the ultrasound evaluation of enthesitis, hybridization of PET imaging with computed tomography and MRI for the evaluation of the axial and peripheral skeleton, as well as advances within MRI such as whole-body MRI and diffusion-weighted sequences. These techniques will be presented and their advantages and disadvantages will be critically discussed. Summary Promising new techniques in the field of SpA imaging are constantly emerging. The benefits and advantages of the presented techniques over the known ones need further validation. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study sets out to analyze the stages of water bodies in the Amazon basin derived from the processing of ERS-2 and ENVISAT satellite altimetry data. For ENVISAT, GDR measurements for both Ice-1 and Ice-2 tracking algorithms were tested. For ERS-2, the Ice-2 data produced by the OSCAR project was used. Water level time series over river segments of very different width, from several kilometers to less than a hundred of meters, were studied. The water level time series that can be derived from narrow riverbeds are enhanced by off-nadir detections. Conversely, the off-nadir effect may degrade the series over large bodies if not properly accounted for. Comparison at crossovers and with in situ gauges shows that the quality of the series can be highly variable, from 12. cm in the best cases and 40. cm in most cases to several meters in the worse cases. Cautious data selection is clearly a key point to achieve high quality series. Indeed, low quality series mostly result from inclusion of outliers in the data set finally retained for the computation of the series. Ice-2 and Ice-1 tracking algorithms in the ENVISAT data perform almost equally well. ENVISAT altimetry is clearly an improvement on ERS-2 altimetry. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The fluvial belt of the Amazon River is a complex of Quaternary sedimentary units of different ages and formation conditions. Present position of the channel and the morphology and size of the alluvial plain are related to neo-tectonic lineaments. In the study area the main channel of the Solimōes is nearly straight. The river may be considered anastomosed, albeit with few islands and anabranches. The main Holocene units are the impeded floodplain and the channel-dominated floodplain. The channel-dominated floodplain is a complex mosaic of fluvial forms, including younger channels, active sandbars, islands, levees, scroll-dominated plains, and abandoned belts. The impeded floodplain is a widespread unit characterised by a very flat surface and round or irregularly shaped lakes. The impeded drainage flood plain is only partially affected by the present floods, and even those parts affected by floods receive little or no sediment from the main channel. More important sediment contribution is by alluvial plain channels from the Solimōes branches that generate deltas in the impeded floodplain lakes. The impeded floodplain is interpreted to be an earlier stage in the evolution of the Holocene alluvial belt. The formation was marked by widespread vertical accretion and a channel morphogenetically less active than at present. The later stage is associated with an active main channel and the paran{\'{a}}s, and generation of a scroll-dominated plain. This very large river system had a complex and delayed response to variations in the hydrological conditions induced by changes in the regional climate during the Late Holocene. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents a description, sensitivity analyses, sample results, validation, and the recent progress done on the development of a new satellite rainfall estimation technique in the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The technique, called the auto-estimator, runs in real time for applications to flash flood forecasting, numerical modeling, operational hydrology. The auto-estimator uses the Geoestationary Operational Environmental Satellite-8 and -9 in the infrared (IR) 10.7-$\mu$m band to compute real-time precipitation amounts based on a power-law regression algorithm. This regression is derived from a statistical analysis between surface radar-derived instantaneous rainfall estimates and satellite-derived IR cloudtop temperatures collocated in time and space. The rainfall rate estimates are adjusted for different moisture regimes using the most recent fields of precipitable water and relative humidity generated by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Eta Model. In addition, a mask is computed to restrict rain to regions satisfying two criteria: (a) the growth rate of the cloud as a function of the temperature change of the cloud tops in two consecutive IR images must be positive, and (b) the spatial gradients of the cloud-top temperature field must show distinct and isolated cold cores in the cloud-top surface. Both the growth rate and the gradient corrections are useful for locating heavy precipitation cores. The auto-estimator has been used experimentally for almost 3 yr to provide real-time instantaneous rainfall rate estimates, average hourly estimates, and 3-, 6-, and 24-h accumulations over the conterminous 48 United States and nearby ocean areas. The NOAA/NESDIS Satellite Analyses Branch (SAB) has examined the accuracy of the rainfall estimates daily for a variety of storm systems. They have determined that the algorithm produces useful 1-6-h estimates for flash flood monitoring but exaggerates the area of precipitation causing overestimation of 24-h rainfall total associated with slow-moving, cold-topped mesoscale convective systems. The SAB analyses have also shown a tendency for underestimation of rainfall rates in warm-top stratiform cloud systems. Until further improvements, the use of this technique for stratiform events should be considered with caution. The authors validate the hourly rainfall rates of the auto-estimator using gauge-adjusted radar precipitation products (with radar bias removed) in three distinct cases. Results show that the auto-estimator has modest skill at 1-h time resolution for a spatial resolution of 12 km. Results improve with larger grid sizes (48 by 48 km or larger).},

abstract = {In the present study, we focus on the assimilation of satellite observations for Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) in a hydrological model. The satellite data are produced in the framework of the EUMETSAT project H-SAF and are based on measurements with the Advanced radar Scatterometer (ASCAT), embarked on the Meteorological Operational satellites (MetOp). The product generated with these measurements has a horizontal resolution of 25km and represents the upper few centimeters of soil. Our approach is based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter technique (EnKF), where observation and model uncertainties are taken into account, implemented in a conceptual hydrological model. The analysis is carried out in the Demer catchment of the Scheldt River Basin in Belgium, for the period from June 2013–May 2016. In this context, two methodological advances are being proposed. First, the generation of stochastic terms, necessary for the EnKF, of bounded variables like SSM is addressed with the aid of specially-designed probability distributions, so that the bounds are never exceeded. Second, bias due to the assimilation procedure itself is removed using a post-processing technique. Subsequently, the impact of SSM assimilation on the simulated streamflow is estimated using a series of statistical measures based on the ensemble average. The differences from the control simulation are then assessed using a two-dimensional bootstrap sampling on the ensemble generated by the assimilation procedure. Our analysis shows that data assimilation combined with bias correction can improve the streamflow estimations or, at a minimum, produce results statistically indistinguishable from the control run of the hydrological model.},

abstract = {Deforestation and drought are among the greatest environmental pressures on the Amazon rainforest, possibly destabilizing the forest-climate system. Deforestation in the Amazon reduces rainfall regionally, while this deforestation itself has been reported to be facilitated by droughts. Here we quantify the interactions between drought and deforestation spatially across the Amazon during the early 21st century. First, we relate observed fluctuations in deforestation rates to dry-season intensity; second, we determine the effect of conversion of forest to cropland on evapotranspiration; and third, we simulate the subsequent downwind reductions in rainfall due to decreased atmospheric water input. We find large variability in the response of deforestation to dry-season intensity, with a significant but small average increase in deforestation rates with a more intense dry season: With every mm of water deficit, deforestation tends to increase by 0.13% per year. Deforestation, in turn, has caused an estimated 4% of the recent observed drying, with the south-western part of the Amazon being most strongly affected. Combining both effects, we quantify a reinforcing drought-deforestation feedback that is currently small, but becomes gradually stronger with cumulative deforestation. Our results suggest that global climate change, not deforestation, is the main driver of recent drying in the Amazon. However, a feedback between drought and deforestation implies that increases in either of them will impede efforts to curb both.},

Although the variability of the Amazon hydrological cycle has been increasing since the late 1990s, its underlying causes have remained elusive. We use water levels in the Amazon River to quantify changes in extreme events and then analyze their cause. Despite continuing research emphasis on droughts, the largest change over recent decades is a marked increase in very severe floods. Increased flooding is linked to a strengthening of the Walker circulation, resulting from strong tropical Atlantic warming and tropical Pacific cooling. Atlantic warming due to combined anthropogenic and natural factors has contributed to enhance the change in atmospheric circulation. Whether this anomalous increase in flooding will last depends on the evolution of the tropical inter-ocean temperature difference.},

abstract = {Simultaneous rainfall analyses using Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave measurements and thermal infrared measurements from Meteosat are presented for two storms over northern Italy that caused damaging floods. Upwelling brightness temperatures over precipitating clouds in the mm-cm spectrum are directly associated with precipitation microphysics throughout the cloud column down into the rain layer. In contrast, brightness temperatures in the thermal infrared window, which arise from emission near cloud top, are not directly responsive to precipitation processes. However, because of the diffraction-limited nature of passive microwave detectors, microwave radiometer ground footprints are considerably larger than those characteristic of infrared sensors, even those flown at geosynchronous altitude. Furthermore, passive microwave radiometers are flown on low-earth orbiters, which produce less than ideal sampling rates, whereas optical-infrared radiometers flown on geosynchronous orbiters produce high frequency sampling concomitant with precipitation time scales. In this study, we investigate how these two types of measuring systems could be used in a complementary fashion to improve rainfall estimation. A physically based microwave algorithm is used to estimate rainfall with SSM/I measurements, whereas a two-threshold statistical technique is used for corresponding estimates from Meteosat. Results suggest that an infrared-based analysis of rainfall derived from half-hourly geosynchronous images can be improved with a calibration-transfer approach using a microwave algorithm sensitive to vertical cloud structure.},

abstract = {Rainfall and soil moisture, SM, are two important quantities for modeling the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere. Usually, rainfall observations are used as input data for modeling the time evolution of SM within hydrological and land surface models. In this study, by inverting the soil-water balance equation, a simple analytical relationship for estimating rainfall accumulations from the knowledge of SM time series is obtained. In situ and satellite SM observations from three different sites in Italy, Spain, and France are used to test the reliability of the proposed approach in contrasting climatic conditions. The results show that the model is able to satisfactorily reproduce daily rainfall data when in situ SM observations are employed (correlation coefficient, R, nearly equal to 0.9). Furthermore, also by using satellite data reasonable results are obtained in reproducing 4 day rainfall accumulations with R-values close to 0.8. Based on these preliminary results, the proposed approach can be adopted conveniently to improve rainfall estimation at a catchment scale and as a supplementary source of data to estimate rainfall at a global scale. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {This paper describes a newalgorithmthat is able to detect snowfall and retrieve the associated snow water path (SWP), for any surface type, using the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI). The algorithm is tuned and evaluated against coincident observations of the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) onboard CloudSat. It is composed of three modules for (i) snowfall detection, (ii) supercooled droplet detection and (iii) SWP retrieval. This algorithm takes into account environmental conditions to retrieve SWP and does not rely on any surface classification scheme. The snowfall detection module is able to detect 83% of snowfall events including light SWP (down to 1 × 10-3 kg{\textperiodcentered}m-2) with a false alarm ratio of 0.12. The supercooled detection module detects 97% of events, with a false alarm ratio of 0.05. The SWP estimates show a relative bias of -11%, a correlation of 0.84 and a root mean square error of 0.04 kg{\textperiodcentered}m-2. Several applications of the algorithm are highlighted: Three case studies of snowfall events are investigated, and a 2-year high resolution 70°S-70°N snowfall occurrence distribution is presented. These results illustrate the high potential of this algorithm for snowfall detection and SWP retrieval using GMI.},

Several neural networks are tested, from multilayer perceptron to adaptative resonance theory architectures. The NN analytical selection process is explained. Half-hourly rain gauge data over Andalusia, Spain, are used for validation purposes. Several interpolation procedures are tested to transform point to areal measurements, including the maximum entropy estimation method. Rainfall estimations are also compared with Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite precipitation index and histogram-matching results.

abstract = {The Amazon river basin receives $\sim$2000 mm of precipitation annually and contributes $\sim$17% of global river freshwater input to the oceans; its hydroclimatic variations can exert profound impacts on the marine ecosystem in the Amazon plume region (APR) and have potential far-reaching influences on hydroclimate over the tropical Atlantic. Here, we show that an amplified seasonal cycle of Amazonia precipitation, represented by the annual difference between maximum and minimum values, during the period 1979–2018, leads to enhanced seasonalities in both Amazon river discharge and APR ocean salinity. An atmospheric moisture budget analysis shows that these enhanced seasonal cycles are associated with similar amplifications in the atmospheric vertical and horizontal moisture advections. Hierarchical sensitivity experiments using global climate models quantify the relationships of these enhanced seasonalities. The results suggest that an intensified hydroclimatological cycle may develop in the Amazonia atmosphere-land-ocean coupled system, favouring more extreme terrestrial and marine conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract. Deforestation in Amazon is expected to decrease evapotranspiration (ET) and to increase soil moisture and river discharge under prevailing energy-limited conditions. The magnitude and sign of the response of ET to deforestation depend both on the magnitude and regional patterns of land-cover change (LCC), as well as on climate change and CO2 levels. On the one hand, elevated CO2 decreases leaf-scale transpiration, but this effect could be offset by increased foliar area density. Using three regional LCC scenarios specifically established for the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon, we investigate the impacts of climate change and deforestation on the surface hydrology of the Amazon Basin for this century, taking 2009 as a reference. For each LCC scenario, three land surface models (LSMs), LPJmL-DGVM, INLAND-DGVM and ORCHIDEE, are forced by bias-corrected climate simulated by three general circulation models (GCMs) of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). On average, over the Amazon Basin with no deforestation, the GCM results indicate a temperature increase of 3.3 °C by 2100 which drives up the evaporative demand, whereby precipitation increases by 8.5 %, with a large uncertainty across GCMs. In the case of no deforestation, we found that ET and runoff increase by 5.0 and 14 %, respectively. However, in south-east Amazonia, precipitation decreases by 10 % at the end of the dry season and the three LSMs produce a 6 % decrease of ET, which is less than precipitation, so that runoff decreases by 22 %. For instance, the minimum river discharge of the Rio Tapaj{\'{o}}s is reduced by 31 % in 2100. To study the additional effect of deforestation, we prescribed to the LSMs three contrasted LCC scenarios, with a forest decline going from 7 to 34 % over this century. All three scenarios partly offset the climate-induced increase of ET, and runoff increases over the entire Amazon. In the south-east, however, deforestation amplifies the decrease of ET at the end of dry season, leading to a large increase of runoff (up to +27 % in the extreme deforestation case), offsetting the negative effect of climate change, thus balancing the decrease of low flows in the Rio Tapaj{\'{o}}s. These projections are associated with large uncertainties, which we attribute separately to the differences in LSMs, GCMs and to the uncertain range of deforestation. At the subcatchment scale, the uncertainty range on ET changes is shown to first depend on GCMs, while the uncertainty of runoff projections is predominantly induced by LSM structural differences. By contrast, we found that the uncertainty in both ET and runoff changes attributable to uncertain future deforestation is low.},

abstract = {Studies that relate changes in land cover with changes in river discharge at the small scale (< 1 km2) are abundant. These studies generally indicate that deforestation causes an increase in the annual mean discharge. However, previous studies that evaluated the effects of changes in land cover in larger river basins (> 100 km2) usually have not found similar relationships. Here we analyse a 50-year long time series of discharge of a tropical river, the Tocantins River at Porto Nacional (175,360 km2), as well as precipitation over this drainage area, during a period where substantial changes in land cover occurred in the basin (1949-1998). Based on agricultural census data, we estimate that, in 1960, about 30% of the basin was used for agriculture. Previous work indicates that by 1995, agriculture had increased substantially, with about 49% of the basin land used as cropland and pastures. Initially, we compare one period with little changes in land cover (period 1-1949-1968) with another with more intense changes in land cover (period 2-1979-1998). Our analysis indicates that, while precipitation over the basin is not statistically different between period 1 and period 2 ($\alpha$ = 0.05), annual mean discharge in period 2 is 24% greater than in period 1 (P < 0.02), and the high-flow season discharge is greater by 28% (P < 0.01). Further analyses present additional evidence that the change in vegetation cover altered the hydrological response of this region. As the pressure for changes in land cover in that region continue to increase, one can expect important further changes in the hydrological regime of the Tocantins River. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Rainfall and soil moisture, SM, are two important quantities for modeling the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere. Usually, rainfall observations are used as input data for modeling the time evolution of SM within hydrological and land surface models. In this study, by inverting the soil-water balance equation, a simple analytical relationship for estimating rainfall accumulations from the knowledge of SM time series is obtained. In situ and satellite SM observations from three different sites in Italy, Spain, and France are used to test the reliability of the proposed approach in contrasting climatic conditions. The results show that the model is able to satisfactorily reproduce daily rainfall data when in situ SM observations are employed (correlation coefficient, R, nearly equal to 0.9). Furthermore, also by using satellite data reasonable results are obtained in reproducing 4 day rainfall accumulations with R-values close to 0.8. Based on these preliminary results, the proposed approach can be adopted conveniently to improve rainfall estimation at a catchment scale and as a supplementary source of data to estimate rainfall at a global scale. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Flood modeling at global scales represents a revolution in hydraulic science and has the potential to transform decision-making and risk management in a wide variety of fields. Such modeling draws on a rich heritage of algorithm and data set development in hydraulic modeling over the last 20 years, but conceptually the challenges of global flood modeling are the same as those faced at local and reach scales. This chapter therefore examines recent progress in the field of global flood hazard modeling and, in particular, looks at the development of so-called ‘hyperresolution' models, defined here as those with a spatial resolution of 1 km or less. This chapter begins by examining how over the last 10 years the field of two-dimensional hydraulic modeling has moved rapidly from the study of single river reaches perhaps 10–60 km in length or restricted local areas of a few kilometers squared, to regional, continental, or even global scale models. This rapid advance has been enabled by three parallel developments: the discovery of new computationally efficient algorithms for solving 2D flow fields, advances in computing power and architectures, and the development of bespoke versions of global terrain data sets optimized for global flood modeling. To illustrate what is now possible this chapter uses the example of a recently developed hyperresolution model: SSBNflow. This is a 1/1200 arc second spatial resolution (∼90 m at the equator) global flood inundation model that solves the local inertial (i.e., a true hydrodynamic) form of the shallow water equations. The hydraulic engine is a clone of the well-known LISFLOOD-FP model. We describe the background to this model and its structure and report the results of a number of extensive validation tests. These show the model to perform well, within the best cases the performance, approaching that of a bespoke model built with local (rather than global) data. We describe how the hazard data can be used to produce global flood risk estimates, and, finally, we provide an extensive discussion of model limitations. Although this is still a young field, the progress, to date, has been rapid. Such models are already making a huge contribution to such fields as disaster risk reduction, disaster forecasting, risk finance, and humanitarian relief efforts, and the prospects for further improvements in model skill are very good.},

abstract = {A process-based methodology is applied to esti-mate land-surface evaporation from multi-satellite informa-tion. GLEAM (Global Land-surface Evaporation: the Am-sterdam Methodology) combines a wide range of remotely-sensed observations to derive daily actual evaporation and its different components. Soil water stress conditions are de-fined from a root-zone profile of soil moisture and used to estimate transpiration based on a Priestley and Taylor equa-tion. The methodology also derives evaporationfrom bare soil and snow sublimation. Tall vegetation rainfall intercep-tion is independently estimated by means of the Gash analyt-ical model. Here, GLEAM is applied daily, at global scale and a quarter degree resolution. Triple collocation is used to calculate the error structure of the evaporation estimates and test the relative merits of two different precipitation in-puts. The spatial distribution of evaporation – and its differ-ent components – is analysed to understand the relative im-portance of each component over different ecosystems. An-nual land evaporation is estimated as 67.9 × 10 3 km 3 , 80% corresponding to transpiration, 11% to interception loss, 7% to bare soil evaporation and 2% snow sublimation. Results show that rainfall interception plays an important role in the partition of precipitation into evaporation and water available for runoff at a continental scale. This study gives insights into the relative importance of precipitation and net radiation in driving evaporation, and how the seasonal influence of these controls varies over different regions. Precipitation is recog-nised as an important factor driving evaporation, not only in areas that have limited soil water availability, but also in ar-eas of high rainfall interception and low available energy.},

abstract = {Tropical deforestation changes the surface energy balance and water cycle, but how much change occurs strongly depends on the land uses that follow deforestation. Here, we quantify how recent (2000-2010) transitions among widespread land uses (i.e., forests, croplands, and pastures) altered the water and energy balance in the Xingu region of southeast Amazonia. Spatial-temporal analyses of multiple satellite data sets revealed that forest-to-crop and forest-to-pasture transitions decreased the net surface radiation (by 18% and 12%, respectively) and latent heat flux (32% and 24%), while increasing sensible heat flux (6% and 9%). Land use transitions during the 2000s reduced contemporaneous evapotranspiration (ET) in the Xingu region by 35 km3 and warmed the land surface temperature (LST) by 0.3 °C. Forest-to-pasture and forest-to-crop transitions accounted for most of the observed ET reduction (25.5 km3 and 7 km3, respectively) and LST increase (0.2 °C and 0.07 °C). Pasture-to-crop transitions reduced ET by an additional 2.5 km3 and increased LST by 0.03 °C. If land use had changed at a similar rate within the region's protected areas, ET would have decreased by another 4.7 km3 and the surface would have warmed an additional 0.5 °C. Forests thus play a key role in regulating regional climate in Amazonia, with protected areas able to attenuate regional climate change caused by land use changes. Our findings show how a major non-GHG forcing, in this case agricultural expansion, has significantly altered regional climate in southeastern Amazonia and how protected forests can mitigate such changes.},

abstract = {Recently developed methodologies such as climate reanalysis make it possible to create a historical record of climate systems. This paper proposes a methodology called Hydrological Retrospective (HR), which essentially simulates large rainfall datasets, using this as input into hydrological models to develop a record of past hydrology, making it possible to analyze past floods and droughts. We developed a methodology for the Amazon basin, where studies have shown an increase in the intensity and frequency of hydrological extreme events in recent decades. We used eight large precipitation datasets (more than 30 years) as input for a large scale hydrological and hydrodynamic model (MGB-IPH). HR products were then validated against several in situ discharge gauges controlling the main Amazon sub-basins, focusing on maximum and minimum events. For the most accurate HR, based on performance metrics, we performed a forecast skill of HR to detect floods and droughts, comparing the results with in-situ observations. A statistical temporal series trend was performed for intensity of seasonal floods and droughts in the entire Amazon basin. Results indicate that HR could represent most past extreme events well, compared with in-situ observed data, and was consistent with many events reported in literature. Because of their flow duration, some minor regional events were not reported in literature but were captured by HR. To represent past regional hydrology and seasonal hydrological extreme events, we believe it is feasible to use some large precipitation datasets such as i) climate reanalysis, which is mainly based on a land surface component, and ii) datasets based on merged products. A significant upward trend in intensity was seen in maximum annual discharge (related to floods) in western and northwestern regions and for minimum annual discharge (related to droughts) in south and central-south regions of the Amazon basin. Because of the global coverage of rainfall datasets, this methodology can be transferred to other regions for better estimation of future hydrological behavior and its impact on society.},

abstract = {Although mining plays an important role for the economy of the Amazon, little is known about its attributes such as area, type, scale, and current status as well as socio/environmental impacts. Therefore, we first propose a low time-consuming and high detection accuracy method for mapping the current mining areas within 13 regions of the Brazilian Amazon using Sentinel-2 images. Then, integrating the maps in a GIS (Geography Information System) environment, mining attributes for each region were further assessed with the aid of the DNPM (National Department for Mineral Production) database. Detection of the mining area was conducted in five main steps. (a) MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument)/Sentinel-2A (S2A) image selection; (b) definition of land-use classes and training samples; (c) supervised classification; (d) vector editing for quality control; and (e) validation with high-resolution RapidEye images (Kappa = 0.70). Mining areas derived from validated S2A classification totals 1084.7 km2 in the regions analyzed. Small-scale mining comprises up to 64% of total mining area detected comprises mostly gold (617.8 km2), followed by tin mining (73.0 km2). The remaining 36% is comprised by industrial mining such as iron (47.8), copper (55.5) and manganese (8.9 km2) in Caraj{\'{a}}s, bauxite in Trombetas (78.4) and Rio Capim (48.5 km2). Given recent events of mining impacts, the large extension of mining areas detected raises a concern regarding its socio-environmental impacts for the Amazonian ecosystems and for local communities.},

The accumulated negative environmental effects of existing dams and proposed dams, if constructed, will trigger massive hydrophysical and biotic disturbances that will affect the Amazon basin's floodplains, estuary and sediment plume. We introduce a Dam Environmental Vulnerability Index to quantify the current and potential impacts of dams in the basin. The scale of foreseeable environmental degradation indicates the need for collective action among nations and states to avoid cumulative, far-reaching impacts.

abstract = {Amazon tropical forests and the semiarid Northeast Brazil (NEB) region have registered very severe droughts during the last two decades, with a frequency that may have exceeded natural climate variability. Severe droughts impact the physiological response of Amazon forests, decreasing the availability to absorb atmospheric CO2, as well as biodiversity and increasing risk of fires. Droughts on this region also affect population by isolating them due to anomalous low river levels. Impacts of droughts over NEB region are related to water and energy security and subsistence agriculture. Most drought episodes over Amazonia and NEB are associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o (EN) events, anomalous warming over the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), and even an overlapping among them. However, not all the dry episodes showed a large-scale pattern linked to a canonical EN event or warm TNA episodes. For instance, dry episodes linked to EN events present distinct spatial patterns of precipitation anomalies depending on EN type (Central-Pacific vs. Eastern-Pacific EN), and NEB region experienced a severe drought in 2012 that is not attributed to EN or warm TNA events. Even in the case of the strong EN in 2015/16, some regional impacts have not been explained by EN contribution. This paper discusses the effects of CP and EP EN events, and the role of warm TNA events on tropical Walker and Hadley circulation leading to drought over Amazonia and NEB regions.},

abstract = {On the Tibetan Plateau, the limited ground-based rainfall information owing to a harsh environment has brought great challenges to hydrological studies. Satellite-based rainfall products, which allow for a better coverage than both radar network and rain gauges on the Tibetan Plateau, can be suitable alternatives for studies on investigating the hydrological processes and climate change. In this study, a newly developed daily satellite-based precipitation product, termed Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), is used as input for a hydrologic model to simulate streamflow in the upper Yellow and Yangtze River basins on the Tibetan Plateau. The results show that the simulated streamflows using PERSIANN-CDR precipitation and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) precipitation are closer to observation than that using limited gauge-based precipitation interpolation in the upper Yangtze River basin. The simulated streamflow using gauge-based precipitation are higher than the streamflow observation during the wet season. In the upper Yellow River basin, gauge-based precipitation, GLDAS precipitation, and PERSIANN-CDR precipitation have similar good performance in simulating streamflow. The evaluation of streamflow simulation capability in this study partly indicates that the PERSIANN-CDR rainfall product has good potential to be a reliable dataset and an alternative information source of a limited gauge network for conducting long-term hydrological and climate studies on the Tibetan Plateau.},

abstract = {Tropical vegetation is a major source of global land surface evapotranspiration, and can thus play a major role in global hydrological cycles and global atmospheric circulation. Accurate prediction of tropical evapotranspiration is critical to our understanding of these processes under changing climate. We examined the controls on evapotranspiration in tropical vegetation at 21 pan-tropical eddy covariance sites, conducted a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of 13 evapotranspiration models at these sites, and assessed the ability to scale up model estimates of evapotranspiration for the test region of Amazonia. Net radiation was the strongest determinant of evapotranspiration (mean evaporative fraction was 0.72) and explained 87% of the variance in monthly evapotranspiration across the sites. Vapor pressure deficit was the strongest residual predictor (14%), followed by normalized difference vegetation index (9%), precipitation (6%) and wind speed (4%). The radiation-based evapotranspiration models performed best overall for three reasons: (1) the vegetation was largely decoupled from atmospheric turbulent transfer (calculated from $\Omega$ decoupling factor), especially at the wetter sites; (2) the resistance-based models were hindered by difficulty in consistently characterizing canopy (and stomatal) resistance in the highly diverse vegetation; (3) the temperature-based models inadequately captured the variability in tropical evapotranspiration. We evaluated the potential to predict regional evapotranspiration for one test region: Amazonia. We estimated an Amazonia-wide evapotranspiration of 1370mmyr-1, but this value is dependent on assumptions about energy balance closure for the tropical eddy covariance sites; a lower value (1096mmyr-1) is considered in discussion on the use of flux data to validate and interpolate models. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = { The southern Amazonia is undergoing a major biophysical transition, involving changes in land use and regional climate. This study provides new insights on the relationship between hydroclimatic variables and vegetation conditions in the upper Madeira Basin ($\sim$1 × 10 6 km 2 ). Vegetative dynamics are characterised using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) while hydroclimatic variability is analysed using satellite-based precipitation, observed river discharge, satellite measurements of terrestrial water storage (TWS) and downward shortwave radiation (DSR). We show that the vegetation in this region varies from energy-limited to water-limited throughout the year. During the peak of the wet season (January-February), rainfall, discharge and TWS are negatively correlated with NDVI in February-April ( r = −0.48 to −0.65; p < 0.05). In addition, DSR is positively correlated with NDVI ( r = 0.47–0.54; p < 0.05), suggesting that the vegetation is mainly energy-limited during this period. Outside this period, these correlations are positive for rainfall, discharge and TWS ( r = 0.55–0.88; p < 0.05), and negative for DSR ( r = −0.47 to −0.54; p < 0.05), suggesting that vegetation depends mainly on water availability, particularly during the vegetation dry season (VDS; late June to late October). Accordantly, the total rainfall during the dry season explains around 80% of the VDS NDVI interannual variance. Considering the predominant land cover types, differences in the hydroclimate-NDVI relationship are observed. Evergreen forests (531,350 km 2 ) remain energy-limited during the beginning of the dry season, but they become water-limited at the end of the VDS. In savannas and flooded savannas (162,850 km 2 ), water dependence occurs months before the onset of the VDS. These differences are more evident during extreme drought years (2007, 2010, and 2011), where regional impacts on NDVI were stronger in savannas and flooded savannas (55% of the entire surface of savannas) than in evergreen forests (40%). A spatial analysis reveals that two specific areas do not show significant hydroclimatic-NDVI correlations during the dry season: (i) the eastern flank of the Andes, characterised by very wet conditions, therefore the vegetation is not water-limited, and (ii) recent deforested areas ($\sim$42,500 km 2 ) that break the natural response in the hydroclimate-vegetation system. These findings are particularly relevant given the increasing rates of deforestation in this region. },

abstract = {A small field campaign was conducted during August 1997 in the Piano di Rosia area in Tuscany, Italy. The terms of both the radiation balance and the surface energy balance were measured by several techniques and for several field sites. Together with a LANDSAT-TM scene of 23 August 1997 of the same area, these data give an excellent opportunity for a profound study of interaction between the radiation and energy fluxes from point to regional scale. A new method to derive the surface energy fluxes from remote sensing measurements, called the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI), is developed, tested and validated with the available data. If the atmospheric conditions over the area can be considered constant and the area reflects sufficient variations in surface hydrological conditions the fluxes can be calculated without any further information than the remote sensing image itself. The results of this case study show that with the relative simple S-SEBI method the surface energy balance parameters can be estimated with a high precision. The measured and estimated evaporative fraction values have a maximum relative difference of 8%.},

abstract = {Satellite-based precipitation products are promising data sources for the hydrometeorological community. However, many of these products lack quantitative estimates of their uncertainty. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation study of the state-of-the-art satellite-based precipitation product: Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) research product (TRMM 3B42) in the middle and upper reaches of Heihe River Basin. The study area locates in arid and semiarid regions in the northwest of China. Both version 6 (V6) and the newly released version 7 (V7) TRMM 3B42 research products are evaluated through statistical analysis and hydrological modeling in this study. We find that the performance of daily TMPA products is climatology-dependent. For the study basin, TMPA products generally perform better in wetter than in drier climatology conditions. High False Alarming Ratio (FAR) and positive bias occur in drier areas, whereas TMPA products display negative bias in wetter regions. TMPA products perform worse in winter when snowfall occurs than in nonsnow seasons. The new V7 TMPA products perform better than V6 on both daily and monthly scales. Hydrological modeling results show that TMPA products are promising in streamflow simulation at ungauged basins in arid and semiarid regions, especially the new V7 whose integrated performance is comparable with that of gauge-based precipitation estimate. When model parameters' sensitivity in forcing precipitation is considered by model recalibration, performances of both two versions of TMPA products are improved, especially for the peak flow simulation in summer. This study can serve as a reference of uncertainty estimates of the TMPA research time precipitation products in hydrometeorological applications at a watershed scale.},

abstract = {Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data are used to indicate mechanisms responsible for extreme summer convection over South America. The three-dimensional reflectivity field is analyzed to define three types of extreme echo, deep convective cores, wide convective cores, and broad stratiform regions. The location and timing of these echoes are sensitive to midlatitude synoptic disturbances crossing the Andes. At the leading edges of these disturbances the nocturnal South American low-level jet (SALLJ) transports moisture along the eastern edge of the Andes from the tropical to the subtropical part of the continent. Where the SALLJ rises over lower but steep mountains on the east side of the southern central Andes, deep and wide convective cores are triggered in the evening. When the SALLJ withdraws to the north as the disturbance passes, nocturnal triggering occurs in the northeastern foothills of the central Andes. Extreme convection over the Amazon basin takes the form of broad stratiform regions that evolve from systems with wide convective cores moving into the center of the region from both the southwest and northeast. The systems from the northeast form at the northeast coast and are likely squall lines. Along the coast of the Brazilian Highlands, diurnal/topographic forcing leads to daytime maxima of deep convective cores followed a few hours later by wide convective cores. Wide convective cores and broad stratiform regions form in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) with a diurnal cycle related to continental heating. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Mesoscale to synoptic-scale squall lines that form along the northeastern coast of South America as sea-breeze-induced instability lines and propagate through the Amazon Basin are investigated using data collected during the April–May 1987 Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE 2B).These systems, termed “Amazon coastal squall lines” (ACSL), have been noted by others, but details of the structure and evolution of the ACSL are limited. The present paper uses Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, radar, upper-air rawinsonde, and surface Portable Automated Mesonet data to describe the structure, dynamics, and life cycle of the ACSL. Twelve ACSL were sampled during ABLE 2B, and three cases are discussed in detail.The ACSL are discontinuous lines of organized mesoscale cloud clusters that propagate across the central Amazon Basin at speeds of 50–60 km h−1. The ACSL undergo six possible life cycle stages: coastal genesis, intensification, maturity, weakening, reintensification, and dissipation. Analysis also indicates that mesoscale clusters within the ACSL are composed of three distinct cloud components: a prestorm region that often contains towering cumulus, leading edge convection (LEC), and multiple, precipitating cloud layers in the trailing stratiform region (TSR).Divergence and vertical velocity calculations indicate deep vertical ascent in the LEC and a region of midlevel convergence (≈500 mb) in the TSR. The latter midlevel convergence is associated with a weak updraft above 500 mb and an unsaturated downdraft below. Vertical motions in the TSR are an order of magnitude smaller than in the LEC.Substantial shear in the low-level inflow occurs in all three case studies and, as suggested by model simulations, may play an important role in the longevity (24–48 h) of the ACSL. Profiles of equivalent potential temperature $\theta$e, taken from the prestorm, leading edge convection and trailing stratiform regions demonstrate that the ACSL stabilize the troposphere in their wake and remove a tropospheric minimum of $\theta$e. It is hypothesized that the removal of this minimum is accomplished both by direct mixing via vertical motions in the LEC ("hot towers") and also through detrainment in the multiple-layered TSR. Part I describes the structure and kinematics of the ACSL, while Part II deals with the heat and moisture transports of these systems.},

Conventional observations through surface gauge networks provide the most direct measure of precipitation, although these are very much limited to land areas, with very few in situ measurements over the oceans. Weather radars, although providing a spatial measure of precipitation, are limited in extent and number. Satellite observations offer an unrivalled vantage point to observe precipitation on a global basis. Since precipitation is spatially and temporally highly variable, satellites are able to provide temporal and spatial samples commensurate with many precipitation characteristics. This paper provides an overall review of global precipitation estimation, providing an outline of conventional measurements, the basis of the satellite systems used in the observation of precipitation, and the generation, availability and validation of the derived precipitation products.

abstract = {During the last decades, satellite observations have increasingly been used to study the global water cycle over land. Although their value is now appreciated by the hydrological community, they are still limited by their uncertainties and their inability to close the water budget. In a previous study, we optimally integrated several datasets for each component (precipitation, evapotranspiration, storage change and discharge) to close this budget at a basin scale. Furthermore, an independent and simple calibration of each satellite dataset was designed to reduce the budget residual. In this paper, we extend the calibration procedure to the global scale. Pixels are first classified into surface types characterized by their NDVI and net precipitation values. We show that the global calibration transforms the original datasets towards a consensus that is hydrologically more coherent, with a budget residual reduced by 26%. The calibrated datasets are compared to ground-based observations, showing an improvement for more than 65% of the sites tested. This opens new perspectives to generate long-term datasets at global scale based purely on all available satellites observations, which describe all the terrestrial water components useful for climate purposes. Beyond the simple calibration presented here, inconsistencies among the various satellite datasets can be used as a proxy for satellite observation uncertainties. The quality of our calibration procedure is constrained by the availability of discharge measurements, and could therefore be improved in the future, as discharge measurement networks become more extensive.},

abstract = {There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: it never rains but it pours! This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid- to high latitudes: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. more bang for the buck, atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Ni o a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Different satellite rainfall products are used in different applications over different parts of the world. These products are particularly important over many parts of Africa, where they are used to augment the very sparse rain-gauge network. However, the quality of the different satellite products varies from one product to another and from one climatic region to another. The climate over eastern Africa varies from wet coastal and mountainous regions to dry arid regions. Significant variations could be observed within short distances. The different climates will pose different challenges to satellite rainfall retrieval over this region. This study explores the effect of mountainous and arid climates on four different satellite rainfall-estimation (RFE) algorithms. The mountainous climate is located over the Ethiopian highlands, while the arid region covers parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. One infrared-only product, African rainfall climatology (ARC), one passive-microwave-only product (the Climate Prediction Center morphing technique, CMORPH) and two products (the RFE algorithm and the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM-3B42)), which combine both infrared and passive-microwave estimates, are used for this investigation. All the products exhibit moderate underestimation of rainfall over the highlands of Ethiopia, while the overestimation over the dry region is found to be very high. The underestimation over the mountainous region is ascribed to the warm orographic rain process, while the overestimation over the dry region may be because of sub-cloud evaporation. Local calibration of satellite algorithms and merging of satellite estimates with all locally available rain-gauge observations are some of the approaches that could be employed to alleviate these problems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {[Nimbus 7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) measurements at five frequencies in the region 6.6 to 37 GHz, at a resolution of 155 km, are analyzed to infer precipitation over the global oceans. The microwave data show, on this spatial scale, that the combined liquid water in the clouds and rain increases the brightness temperature almost linearly with frequency in the 6.6 to 18 GHz region, while at 37 GHz such a simple relationship is not noticed. Further, as the atmospheric water vapor absorption and the effects of scattering by precipitation particles are relatively weak at 6.6 and 10.7 GHz, a technique to remotely sense the liquid water content in the atmosphere is developed based on the brightness measurements at these two frequencies. Seasonal mean patterns of liquid water content in the atmosphere derived from SMMR over global oceans relate closely to climatological patterns of precipitation. Based on this, an empirical relationship is derived to estimate precipitation over the global oceans, with an accuracy of about ±30 percent, on a seasonal basis from satellite measurements made during the three years (1979–81) before the recent El Ni{\~{n}}o event. The deviations from these three-year means, in the precipitation, produced by the 1982–83 El Ni{\~{n}}o event are then deduced from the SMMR measurements. In the Pacific one notices from these deviations that the precipitation over the ITCZ in the north, the South Pacific Convergence Zone, and the oceans around Indonesia is drastically reduced. At the same time a substantial increase in precipitation is observed over the normally dry central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.]},

abstract = {In the tropical Andes, the identification of the present synoptic mechanisms associated with the diurnal cycle of precipitation and its interaction with orography is a key step to understand how the atmospheric circulation influences the patterns of precipitation variability on longer time-scales. In particular we aim to better understand the combination of the local and regional mechanisms controlling the diurnal cycle of summertime (DJF) precipitation in the Northern Central Andes (NCA) region of Southern Peru. A climatology of the diurnal cycle is obtained from 15 wet seasons (2000–2014) of 3-hourly TRMM-3B42 data (0.25° × 0.25°) and swath data from the TRMM-2A25 precipitation radar product (5 km × 5 km). The main findings are: (1) in the NCA region, the diurnal cycle shows a maximum precipitation occurring during the day (night) in the western (eastern) side of the Andes highlands, (2) in the valleys of the Cuzco region and in the Amazon slope of the Andes the maximum (minimum) precipitation occurs during the night (day). The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) regional atmospheric model is used to simulate the mean diurnal cycle in the NCA region for the same period at 27 km and 9 km horizontal grid spacing and 3-hourly output, and at 3 km only for the month of January 2010 in the Cuzco valleys. Sensitivity experiments were also performed to investigate the effect of the topography on the observed rainfall patterns. The model reproduces the main diurnal precipitation features. The main atmospheric processes identified are: (1) the presence of a regional-scale cyclonic circulation strengthening during the afternoon, (2) diurnal thermally driven circulations at local scale, including upslope (downslope) wind and moisture transport during the day (night), (3) channelization of the upslope moisture transport from the Amazon along the Apurimac valleys toward the western part of the cordillera.},

abstract = {Changes in weather and land use are transforming the spatial and temporal characteristics of fire regimes in Amazonia, with important effects on the functioning of dense (i.e., closed-canopy), open-canopy, and transitional forests across the Basin. To quantify, document, and describe the characteristics and recent changes in forest fire regimes, we sampled 6 million ha of these three representative forests of the eastern and southern edges of the Amazon using 24 years (1983-2007) of satellite-derived annual forest fire scar maps and 16 years of monthly hot pixel information (1992-2007). Our results reveal that changes in forest fire regime properties differentially affected these three forest types in terms of area burned and fire scar size, frequency, and seasonality. During the study period, forest fires burned 15% (0.3 million ha), 44% (1 million ha), and 46% (0.6 million ha) of dense, open, and transitional forests, respectively. Total forest area burned and fire scar size tended to increase over time (even in years of average rainfall in open canopy and transitional forests). In dense forests, most of the temporal variability in fire regime properties was linked to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related droughts. Compared with dense forests, transitional and open forests experienced fires twice as frequently, with at least 20% of these forests' areas burning two or more times during the 24-year study period. Open and transitional forests also experienced higher deforestation rates than dense forests. During drier years, the end of the dry season was delayed by about a month, which resulted in larger burn scars and increases in overall area burned later in the season. These observations suggest that climate-mediated forest flammability is enhanced by landscape fragmentation caused by deforestation, as observed for open and transitional forests in the Eastern portion of the Amazon Basin.},

It is a merged analysis that incorporates precipitation estimates from low-orbit satellite microwave data, geosynchronous-orbit satellite infrared data, and surface rain gauge observations. The merging approach utilizes the higher accuracy of the low-orbit microwave observations to calibrate, or adjust, the more frequent geosynchronous infrared observations. The dataset is extended back into the premicrowave era (before mid-1987) by using infrared-only observations calibrated to the microwave-based analysis of the later years. The combined satellite-based product is adjusted by the rain gauge analysis. The dataset archive also contains the individual input fields, a combined satellite estimate, and error estimates for each field. This monthly analysis is the foundation for the GPCP suite of products, including those at finer temporal resolution. The 23-yr GPCP climatology is characterized, along with time and space variations of precipitation.},

abstract = {Two models were evaluated for their ability to estimate land surface evaporation at 16-day intervals using MODIS remote sensing data and surface meteorology as inputs. The first was the aerodynamic resistance-surface energy balance model, and the second was the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, where the required surface conductance is estimated from remotely-sensed leaf area index. The models were tested using 3 years of evaporation and meteorological measurements from two contrasting Australian ecosystems, a cool temperate, evergreen Eucalyptus forest and a wet/dry, tropical savanna. The aerodynamic resistance-surface energy balance approach failed because small errors in the radiative surface temperature translate into large errors in sensible heat, and hence into estimates of evaporation. The P-M model adequately estimated the magnitude and seasonal variation in evaporation in both ecosystems (RMSE = 27 W m- 2, R2 = 0.74), demonstrating the validity of the proposed surface conductance algorithm. This, and the ability to constrain evaporation estimates via the energy balance, demonstrates the superiority of the P-M equation over the surface temperature-based model. There was no degradation in the performance of the P-M model when gridded meteorological data at coarser spatial (0.05°) and temporal (daily) resolution were substituted for locally-measured inputs. The P-M approach was used to generate a monthly evaporation climatology for Australia from 2001 to 2004 to demonstrate the potential of this approach for monitoring land surface evaporation and constructing monthly water budgets from 1-km to continental spatial scales. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The initial satellite precipitation data comparisons show that the reanalyzed 3B42V6, with a bias of -4.54%, matched best with the rain gauge observations, while the two near real-time satellite datasets (3B42RT and CMORPH) largely underestimated precipitation by 42.72% and 40.81% respectively. With the model parameters first benchmarked by the rain gauge data, the behavior of the streamflow simulation from the 3B42V6 was also the most optimal amongst the three products, while the two near real-time satellite datasets produced deteriorated biases and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSCEs). Still, when the model parameters were recalibrated by each individual satellite data, the performance of the streamflow simulations from the two near real-time satellite products were significantly improved, thus demonstrating the need for specific calibrations of the hydrological models for the near real-time satellite inputs. Moreover, when optimally merged with respect to the streamflows forced by the two near real-time satellite precipitation products and all the three satellite precipitation products using the Bayesian model averaging method, the resulted streamflow series further improved and became more robust. In summary, the three current state-of-the-art satellite precipitation products have demonstrated potential in hydrological research and applications. The benchmarking, recalibration, and optimal merging schemes for streamflow simulation at a basin scale described in the present work will hopefully be a reference for future utilizations of satellite precipitation products in global and regional hydrological applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The WAter Cycle Multi-mission Observation Strategy - EvapoTranspiration (WACMOS-ET) project aims to advance the development of land evaporation estimates on global and regional scales. Its main objective is the derivation, validation, and intercomparison of a group of existing evaporation retrieval algorithms driven by a common forcing data set. Three commonly used process-based evaporation methodologies are evaluated: the Penman-Monteith algorithm behind the official Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evaporation product (PM-MOD), the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), and the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL). The resulting global spatiotemporal variability of evaporation, the closure of regional water budgets, and the discrete estimation of land evaporation components or sources (i.e. transpiration, interception loss, and direct soil evaporation) are investigated using river discharge data, independent global evaporation data sets and results from previous studies. In a companion article (Part 1), Michel et al. (2016) inspect the performance of these three models at local scales using measurements from eddy-covariance towers and include in the assessment the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model. In agreement with Part 1, our results indicate that the Priestley and Taylor products (PT-JPL and GLEAM) perform best overall for most ecosystems and climate regimes. While all three evaporation products adequately represent the expected average geographical patterns and seasonality, there is a tendency in PM-MOD to underestimate the flux in the tropics and subtropics. Overall, results from GLEAM and PT-JPL appear more realistic when compared to surface water balances from 837 globally distributed catchments and to separate evaporation estimates from ERA-Interim and the model tree ensemble (MTE). Nonetheless, all products show large dissimilarities during conditions of water stress and drought and deficiencies in the way evaporation is partitioned into its different components. This observed inter-product variability, even when common forcing is used, suggests that caution is necessary in applying a single data set for large-scale studies in isolation. A general finding that different models perform better under different conditions highlights the potential for considering biome- or climate-specific composites of models. Nevertheless, the generation of a multi-product ensemble, with weighting based on validation analyses and uncertainty assessments, is proposed as the best way forward in our long-term goal to develop a robust observational benchmark data set of continental evaporation.},

abstract = {Current global precipitation (P) datasets do not take full advantage of the complementary nature of satellite and reanalysis data. Here, we present Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) version 1.1, a global P dataset for the period 1979-2015 with a 3-hourly temporal and 0.25° spatial resolution, specifically designed for hydrological modeling. The design philosophy of MSWEP was to optimally merge the highest quality P data sources available as a function of timescale and location. The long-term mean of MSWEP was based on the CHPclim dataset but replaced with more accurate regional datasets where available. A correction for gauge under-catch and orographic effects was introduced by inferring catchment-average P from streamflow (Q) observations at 13 762 stations across the globe. The temporal variability of MSWEP was determined by weighted averaging of P anomalies from seven datasets; two based solely on interpolation of gauge observations (CPC Unified and GPCC), three on satellite remote sensing (CMORPH, GSMaP-MVK, and TMPA 3B42RT), and two on atmospheric model reanalysis (ERA-Interim and JRA-55). For each grid cell, the weight assigned to the gauge-based estimates was calculated from the gauge network density, while the weights assigned to the satellite- and reanalysis-based estimates were calculated from their comparative performance at the surrounding gauges. The quality of MSWEP was compared against four state-of-the-art gauge-adjusted P datasets (WFDEI-CRU, GPCP-1DD, TMPA 3B42, and CPC Unified) using independent P data from 125 FLUXNET tower stations around the globe. MSWEP obtained the highest daily correlation coefficient (R) among the five P datasets for 60.0% of the stations and a median R of 0.67 vs. 0.44-0.59 for the other datasets. We further evaluated the performance of MSWEP using hydrological modeling for 9011 catchments (< 50 000 km/2) across the globe. Specifically, we calibrated the simple conceptual hydrological model HBV (Hydrologiska Byr{\"{a}}ns Vattenbalansavdelning) against daily Q observations with P from each of the different datasets. For the 1058 sparsely gauged catchments, representative of 83.9 % of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), MSWEP obtained a median calibration NSE of 0.52 vs. 0.29-0.39 for the other P datasets. MSWEP is available via http://www.gloh2o.org.},

abstract = {Amazonia has been under considerable development pressure as croplands and pasture are established in areas formerly occupied by tropical forest and cerrado. Although this region is an important part of several important planetary biogeochemical cycles, the location and impact of human land use are not well understood. In particular, there is no existing satellite-based map of agriculture across the Amazon or Tocantins river drainage basins. Recent efforts have classified land cover across this vast region, although they disagree on the location and amount of cropland and do not directly address pasture, a land use that has grown in importance in the last 2 decades. Here we present an analysis of land cover and land use practices over the Amazon and Tocantins basins of South America. In this study, we demonstrate how satellite imagery and agricultural censuses can be merged in order to provide a geographically explicit, fine-scale description of land cover and land use practices. The result depicts the fraction of each 5- min (9 × 9 km) grid cell that was devoted to agricultural activity during the mid-1990s. The resultant map retains many of the characteristics of the agricultural census data, but with a much finer spatial resolution. During the mid-1990s, cultivated area is estimated to have been 1.7 × 107 ha (2.5% of the basin), natural pasture is estimated at 3.3 × 107 ha (4.9% of the basin), and planted pasture is estimated to cover 3.3 × 107 ha (4.9% of the basin). Perhaps more important than the quantities, however, is that these data sets provide a new blend of ground-based and satellite-based spatially explicit data. This snapshot can be used as a basis to project either forward or backward in time, as a new check of finer scale land use classifications or as a driver of ecosystem models.},

Taking advantage of a 40-year period of the multi-satellite imagery archive, the objective of this paper is to build a normalized time-series in order to evaluate the influence of temporal mining expansion on the water siltation data (TSS, Total Suspended Solids concentration) derived from previous research. The methodological approach was set to deliver a full characterization of the ASGM expansion from its initial stages in the early 1970s to the present. First, based on IRS/LISSIII images acquired in 2012, the historical Landsat image database (1973–2001) was corrected for radiometric and atmospheric effects using dark vegetation as reference to create a normalized time-series. Next, a complete update of the mining areas distribution in 2012 derived from the TerraClass Project (an official land-use classification for the Brazilian Amazon) was conducted having IRS/LISSIII as the base map with the support of auxiliary data and vector editing. Once the ASGM in 2012 was quantified (261.7 km2) and validated with photos, a reverse classification of ASGM in 2001 (171.7 km2), 1993 (166.3 km2), 1984 (47.5 km2), and 1973 (15.4 km2) with the use of Landsat archives was applied. This procedure relies on the assumption that ASGM changes in the land cover are severe and remain detectable from satellite sensors for decades. The mining expansion area over time was then combined with the (TSS) data retrieved from the same atmospherically corrected satellite imagery based on the literature. In terms of gold mining expansion and water siltation effects, four main periods of ASGM activities were identified in the study area: (i) 1958–1977, first occurrence of mining activities and low water impacts; (ii) 1978–1993, introduction of low-budget mechanization associated with very high gold prices resulting in large mining area expansion and high water siltation levels; (iii) 1994–2003, general recession of ASGM activities and exhaustion of easy-access gold deposits, resulting in decreased TSS; (iv) 2004 to present, intensification of ASGM encouraged by high gold prices, resulting in an increase of TSS.},

abstract = {Patterns of surface sediment concentration distribution in rivers are significant for understanding fluvial morphodynamics and environmental characteristics of the rivers and their floodplains. In the case of the Amazon Basin, complexity in sediment pattern distribution is affected by the anabranching channel pattern of the Amazon River, inputs from tributaries (some of which are among the largest rivers on Earth) and the existence of huge and complex floodplains. In this paper, patterns of surface sediment distribution are modeled based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over the Amazon River by estimating surface sediment concentrations. Specifically, we aim to 1) detect the regional and seasonal variability of surface sediment in the main channel, 2) observe the influence of tributaries into the main system, 3) identify channel-floodplain interactions, and 4) investigate the internal variability of surface sediment along the main channel system. Field surface sediment concentration data from three gauging stations representing the upstream, midstream, and downstream sections of the Amazon River between 2000 and 2010 were used to calibrate 1328 MODIS daily surface reflectance images. Robust empirical models were derived between field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data from each station (0.79<R2<0.92, slopes significant at 99% confidence level) from 752 selected data after quality control. We applied empirical models to 2112 8-day composite surface reflectance images to generate surface sediment distribution maps since 2000. Overall, this study successfully demonstrated the capability of our MODIS-based model to capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface sediments in the Amazon River Basin, the largest river system on Earth. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

This novel approach analyzes climate extreme events over the past four decades (1980–2016) using multiple gridded observation and reanalysis datasets. Furthermore, future changes in climate extremes are analyzed from 20 downscaled Earth System Models (ESMs) at high horizontal resolution (0.25° of latitude/longitude), under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Projected changes in the extreme indices are analyzed over mid-twenty-first century (2046–2065) and end-of-twenty-first century (2081–2100) relative to the reference period 1986–2005. Results show consistent warming patterns with increasing (decreasing) trends in warm (cold) extremes in the historical datasets. A similar but more intense warm pattern is projected in the mid and end of the twenty-first century. For precipitation indices, observations show an increase in consecutive dry days and a reduction of consecutive wet days over almost all Brazil. The frequency and intensity of extremely wet days over Brazil are expected to increase according to future scenarios. Designing effective adaptation and mitigation measures in response to changes in climate extremes events depends on this improved understanding of how conditions have and are likely to change in the future at regional scales.},

abstract = {Despite the very active deforestation of the last decade, the Amazon Basin is still primarily covered with trees and is a system in equilibrium. The Andes form a barrier at the western end of the basin and, coupled with the prevailing easterly winds, ensure an almost unique precipitation and water-recycling regime. On average 50 percent of the precipitation is recycled, and in some areas even more. The soils are poor. Most of the nitrogen and phosphorus is found in the soil, and the remaining nutrient elements are found in the standing biomass. There is some nutrient recycling and little loss from the intact ecosystem, and the small input of nutrients from precipitation maintains a small positive nutrient balance. Continued large-scale deforestation is likely to lead to increased erosion and water runoff with initial flooding in the lower Amazon, together with reduced evapotranspiration and ultimately reduced precipitation. Reduced precipitation in the Amazon could increase the tendency toward continentality and adversely affect climate and the present agriculture in south-central Brazil.},

Nevertheless, climate model predictions vary from rapid drying to modest wetting. Here we report that the catchment of the world's largest river is experiencing a substantial wetting trend since approximately 1990. This intensification of the hydrological cycle is concentrated overwhelmingly in the wet season driving progressively greater differences in Amazon peak and minimum flows. The onset of the trend coincides with the onset of an upward trend in tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). This positive longer-term correlation contrasts with the short-term, negative response of basin- wide precipitation to positive anomalies in tropical North Atlantic SST, which are driven by temporary shifts in the intertropical convergence zone position. We propose that the Amazon precipitation changes since 1990 are instead related to increasing atmospheric water vapor import from the warming tropical Atlantic},

abstract = {Satellites are an alternative source of rainfall data used as input to hydrological models in poorly gauged or ungauged regions. They are also useful in regions with highly heterogeneous precipitation, such as the tropical Andes. This paper evaluates three satellite precipitation datasets (TMPA, CMORPH, PERSIANN), as well as a dataset based only on rain gauge data (HYBAM), and their impacts on the water balance of the Western Amazon basin, a region where hydrological modeling and hydrological forecasting are poorly developed. These datasets were used as inputs in the MGB-IPH hydrological model to simulate streamflows for the 2003-2009 period. The impacts of precipitation on model parameterization and outputs were evaluated in two calibration experiments. In Experiment 1, parameter sets were separately defined for each catchment; in Experiment 2, a single parameter set was defined for the entire basin. TMPA shows overestimated precipitation over the northern region, while CMORPH and PERSIANN significantly underestimate rainfall in the same that region and along the Andes. TMPA and CMORPH lead to similar estimates of mean evapotranspiration ($\sim$2. mm/day) for different regions along the entire basin, while PERSIANN is the least accurate ($\sim$0.5. mm/day). Overall, better scores for streamflow simulations are obtained with Experiment 1 forced by HYBAM and TMPA. Nevertheless, results using the three satellite datasets indicate inter-basin differences, low performance in the northern and high in the southern regions. Low model performances are mainly related to scale issues and forcing errors in small basins over regions that present very low rainfall seasonality.},

However, the majority of the land surface of the earth lacks such data, and in many parts of the world the density of surface precipitation gauging networks is even rapidly declining. This development can potentially be counteracted by using received signal level data from the enormous number of microwave links used worldwide in commercial cellular communication networks. Along such links, radio signals propagate from a transmitting antenna at one base station to a receiving antenna at another base station. Rain-induced attenuation and, subsequently, path-averaged rainfall intensity can be retrieved from the signal's attenuation between transmitter and receiver. Here, we show how one such a network can be used to retrieve the space-time dynamics of rainfall for an entire country (The Netherlands, ∼35,500 km2), based on an unprecedented number of links (∼2,400) and a rainfall retrieval algorithm that can be applied in real time. This demonstrates the potential of such networks for real-time rainfall monitoring, in particular in those parts of the world where networks of dedicated ground-based rainfall sensors are often virtually absent.},

abstract = {Atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations predict that a complete deforestation of the Amazon basin would lead to a significant climate change; however, it is more difficult to determine the amount of deforestation that would lead to a detectable climate change. This paper examines whether cloudiness has already changed locally in the Brazilian arc of deforestation, one of the most deforested regions of the Amazon basin, where over 15% of the primary forest has been converted to pasture and agriculture. Three pairs of deforested/forested areas have been selected at a scale compatible with that of climate model grids to compare changes in land cover with changes in cloudiness observed in satellite data over a 10-year period from 1984 to 1993. Analysis of cloud cover trends suggests that a regional climate change may already be underway in the most deforested part of the arc of deforestation. Although changes in cloud cover over deforested areas are not significant for interannual variations, they are for the seasonal and diurnal distributions. During the dry season, observations show more low-level clouds in early afternoon and less convection at night and in early morning over deforested areas. During the wet season, convective cloudiness is enhanced in the early night over deforested areas. Generally speaking, the results suggest that deforestation may lead to increased seasonality; however, some of the differences observed between deforested and forested areas may be related to their different geographical locations. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {A new technique is presented in which half-hourly global precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave satellite scans are propagated by motion vectors derived from geostationary satellite infrared data. The Climate Prediction Center morphing method (CMORPH) uses motion vectors derived from half-hourly interval geostationary satellite IR imagery to propagate the relatively high quality precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data. In addition, the shape and intensity of the precipitation features are modified (morphed) during the time between microwave sensor scans by performing a time-weighted linear interpolation. This process yields spatially and temporally complete microwave-derived precipitation analyses, independent of the infrared temperature field. CMORPH showed substantial improvements over both simple averaging of the microwave estimates and over techniques that blend microwave and infrared information but that derive estimates of precipitation from infrared data when passive microwave information is unavailable. In particular, CMORPH outperforms these blended techniques in terms of daily spatial correlation with a validating rain gauge analysis over Australia by an average of 0.14, 0.27, 0.26, 0.22, and 0.20 for April, May, June-August, September, and October 2003, respectively.

Over the United States for June-August, September, and October 2003, spatial correlation was higher for CMORPH relative to the average of the same techniques by an average of 0.10, 0.13, and 0.13, respectively, and equitable threat scores were higher by an average of 0.06, 0.09, and 0.10, respectively.},

The scale of foreseeable environmental degradation indicates the need for collective action among nations and states to avoid cumulative, far-reaching impacts. We suggest institutional innovations to assess and avoid the likely impoverishment of Amazon rivers.},

abstract = {This study sets out to analyze the stages of water bodies in the Amazon basin derived from the processing of ERS-2 and ENVISAT satellite altimetry data. For ENVISAT, GDR measurements for both Ice-1 and Ice-2 tracking algorithms were tested. For ERS-2, the Ice-2 data produced by the OSCAR project was used. Water level time series over river segments of very different width, from several kilometers to less than a hundred of meters, were studied. The water level time series that can be derived from narrow riverbeds are enhanced by off-nadir detections. Conversely, the off-nadir effect may degrade the series over large bodies if not properly accounted for. Comparison at crossovers and with in situ gauges shows that the quality of the series can be highly variable, from 12. cm in the best cases and 40. cm in most cases to several meters in the worse cases. Cautious data selection is clearly a key point to achieve high quality series. Indeed, low quality series mostly result from inclusion of outliers in the data set finally retained for the computation of the series. Ice-2 and Ice-1 tracking algorithms in the ENVISAT data perform almost equally well. ENVISAT altimetry is clearly an improvement on ERS-2 altimetry. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This study is a geochemical investigation of the Andean and Foreland basins of the Amazon River at high spatial and time resolution, carried out within the framework of the HYBAM research program (Hydro-geodynamics of the Amazon Basin). Monthly sampling was carried out at 27 gauging stations located in the upper tributaries of the Amazon Basin (from north to south: the Napo, Mara{\~{n}}on, Ucayali, Madre de Dios-Beni and Mamore Rivers). The aim of this paper is to estimate the present-day chemical weathering rate (CWR), as well as the flux of CO2 consumption from total and silicate weathering in the Andes and Foreland Amazon basins, and to discuss their distribution as a function of geomorphic and structural parameters. Based on the forward method, the Napo and other Ecuadorian basins present high silicate weathering rates in comparison with the other basins. We confirm that the Mara{\~{n}}on and Ucayali Rivers control the Amazon hydrochemistry due to the presence of salt rocks and carbonates in these basins. The Madre de Dios, Beni and Mamore basins do not contribute much to the Amazon dissolved load. This north to south CWR gradient can be explained by the combination of decreasing weatherable lithology surface and decreasing runoff rates from the north to the south. The foreland part of the basins (or Mountain-Lowland transition) accounts for nearly the same proportion of the Amazon silicate chemical weathering and carbonate chemical weathering fluxes as the Andean part. This result demonstrates the importance of the sediment accumulation areas in the Amazon Basin weathering budget and can be explained by the occurrence of a higher temperature, the deposition of fresh sediments from Andean erosion and a higher sediment residence time than in the upper part of the basin. With a total CO2 consumption rate of 744.103moleskm-2year-1 and a silicate CO2 consumption rate of 300.103moleskm-2year-1, the Upper Amazon River (Andes+Foreland part) is the most intense part of the Amazon Basin in terms of atmospheric CO2 consumption by weathering processes. It is an important CO2 sink by weathering processes but accounts for only somewhat more than half of the CO2 consumption by silicate weathering of the Amazon Basin. This result points out the importance of the Lowland part of the basin in the inorganic C silicate budget. The Upper Amazon accounts for 2-4% of the world's silicate CO2 consumption, which is the same proportion as for the southern and southern-east Himalaya and Tibetan plateau. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, which provides the new generation of rainfall estimates, is now considered a global successor to TRMM. The usefulness of GPM data in hydrological applications, however, has not yet been evaluated over the Andean and Amazonian regions. This study uses GPM data provided by the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals (IMERG) (product/final run) as input to a distributed hydrological model for the Amazon Basin of Peru and Ecuador for a 16-month period (from March 2014 to June 2015) when all datasets are available. TRMM products (TMPA V7 and TMPA RT datasets) and a gridded precipitation dataset processed from observed rainfall are used for comparison. The results indicate that precipitation data derived from GPM-IMERG correspond more closely to TMPA V7 than TMPA RT datasets, but both GPM-IMERG and TMPA V7 precipitation data tend to overestimate, compared to observed rainfall (by 11.1 and 15.7 %, respectively). In general, GPM-IMERG, TMPA V7 and TMPA RT correlate with observed rainfall, with a similar number of rain events correctly detected (∼ 20 %). Statistical analysis of modeled streamflows indicates that GPM-IMERG is as useful as TMPA V7 or TMPA RT datasets in southern regions (Ucayali Basin). GPM-IMERG, TMPA V7 and TMPA RT do not properly simulate streamflows in northern regions (Mara{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n and Napo basins), probably because of the lack of adequate rainfall estimates in northern Peru and the Ecuadorian Amazon.},

This study presents and evaluates the Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP), which is a global flow routing scheme specifically designed to bridge the gap between current state-of-the-art global flow routing schemes by combining their main features and introducing new features to better capture floodplain dynamics. The ultimate goals of HyMAP are to provide the scientific community with a novel scheme suited to the assimilation of satellite altimetry data for global water discharge forecasts and a model that can be potentially coupled with atmospheric models. In this first model evaluation, HyMAP is coupled with the Interactions between Soil?Biosphere?Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model in order to simulate the surface water dynamics in the Amazon basin. The model is evaluated over the 1986?2006 period against an unprecedented source of information, including in situ and satellite-based datasets of water discharge and level, flow velocity, and floodplain extent. Results show that the model can satisfactorily simulate the large-scale features of the water surface dynamics of the Amazon River basin. Among all stream gauges considered, 23% have Nash?Sutcliffe coefficients (NS) higher than 0.50 and 68% above zero. About 28% of the stations have volume errors lower than 15%. Simulated discharges at ?bidos had NS = 0.89. Time series of simulated floodplains at the basin scale agrees well with satellite-based estimates, with a relative error of 7% and correlation of 0.89. These results indicate nonnegligible improvements in comparison to previous studies for the same region.},

The adjustment is based on the spatially variable ratio of rainrate estimates from coincident microwave and infrared data, which is then applied to the full geo-IR data set. The resulting "microwave-adjusted geo-IR rain estimate' has the (usually low) bias of the microwave estimates, together with the smoothness and temporal coverage of the geo-IR data. Here, the microwave estimates from the Goddard Scattering Algorithm (GSCAT) are used to adjust the geo-IR estimates from the Geosynchronous Precipitation Index (GPI) to form the Adjusted GPI (AGPI) technique. -from Authors},

abstract = {A new technique is presented in which half-hourly global precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave satellite scans are propagated by motion vectors derived from geostationary satellite infrared data. The Climate Prediction Center morphing method (CMORPH) uses motion vectors derived from half-hourly interval geostationary satellite IR imagery to propagate the relatively high quality precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data. In addition, the shape and intensity of the precipitation features are modified (morphed) during the time between microwave sensor scans by performing a time-weighted linear interpolation. This process yields spatially and temporally complete microwave-derived precipitation analyses, independent of the infrared temperature field. CMORPH showed substantial improvements over both simple averaging of the microwave estimates and over techniques that blend microwave and infrared information but that derive estimates of precipitation from infrared data when passive microwave information is unavailable. In particular, CMORPH outperforms these blended techniques in terms of daily spatial correlation with a validating rain gauge analysis over Australia by an average of 0.14, 0.27, 0.26, 0.22, and 0.20 for April, May, June-August, September, and October 2003, respectively. CMORPH also yields higher equitable threat scores over Australia for the same periods by an average of 0.11, 0.14, 0.13, 0.14, and 0.13. Over the United States for June-August, September, and October 2003, spatial correlation was higher for CMORPH relative to the average of the same techniques by an average of 0.10, 0.13, and 0.13, respectively, and equitable threat scores were higher by an average of 0.06, 0.09, and 0.10, respectively.},

abstract = {A suite of climate change indices derived from daily temperature and precipitation data, with a primary focus on extreme events, were computed and analyzed. By setting an exact formula for each index and using specially designed software, analyses done in different countries have been combined seamlessly. This has enabled the presentation of the most up-to-date and comprehensive global picture of trends in extreme temperature and precipitation indices using results from a number of workshops held in data-sparse regions and high-quality station data supplied by numerous scientists world wide. Seasonal and annual indices for the period 1951-2003 were gridded. Trends in the gridded fields were computed and tested for statistical significance. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature. Over 70% of the global land area sampled showed a significant decrease in the annual occurrence of cold nights and a significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm nights. Some regions experienced a more than doubling of these indices. This implies a positive shift in the distribution of daily minimum temperature throughout the globe. Daily maximum temperature indices showed similar changes but with smaller magnitudes. Precipitation changes showed a widespread and significant increase, but the changes are much less spatially coherent compared with temperature change. Probability distributions of indices derived from approximately 200 temperature and 600 precipitation stations, with near-complete data for 1901-2003 and covering a very large region of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (and parts of Australia for precipitation) were analyzed for the periods 1901-1950, 1951-1978 and 1979-2003. Results indicate a significant warming throughout the 20th century. Differences in temperature indices distributions are particularly pronounced between the most recent two periods and for those indices related to minimum temperature. An analysis of those indices for which seasonal time series are available shows that these changes occur for all seasons although they are generally least pronounced for September to November. Precipitation indices show a tendency toward wetter conditions throughout the 20th century.},

abstract = {Data obtained from NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites were used to investigate the relationships between topography, large-scale circulation, and the climatology of precipitation and cloudiness in the Andes - specifically over Peru and the Altiplano Plateau - at diurnal, seasonal, and interannual time scales. The spatial variability of cloudiness was assessed through empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of GOES brightness temperatures. Results indicate that landform is the principal agent of the space-time variability of moist atmospheric processes in the Andes, with the first mode explaining up to 70% of all observed variability. These results substantiate the differences between "continental" (Andes and Himalayas) and "maritime" (Western Cordillera) orographic precipitation regimes, reflecting the degree to which upwind landmasses modulate moisture transport toward and across mountain barriers. GOES brightness temperatures show that afternoon convective activity during the rainy season is more intense on wet hydrometeorological years such as 2001, whereas the space-time structure of nighttime cloudiness at the foothills and outlets of deep interior valleys does not change during the monsoon and from one year to another independently of large-scale conditions. This suggests that daytime cloud formation and precipitation is strongly dependent on large-scale moisture transport. Interactions between mesoscale and ridge-valley circulations, which are locked to the topography, determine the space-time organization of clouds and precipitation at nighttime. This leads to strong clustering of precipitation features associated with enhanced convection at high elevations along the ridges and near the headwaters of the major river systems in the TRMM data. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

One year (August 1998-July 1999) of tropical rainfall estimates from the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) systems were used to produce monthly means of rainfall diurnal cycles at hourly and 1° × 1° scales over a domain (30°S-30°N, 80°E-10°W) from the Americas across the Pacific Ocean to Australia and eastern Asia. The results demonstrate pronounced diurnal variability of tropical rainfall intensity at synoptic and regional scales. Seasonal signals of diurnal rainfall are presented over the large domain of the tropical Pacific Ocean, especially over the ITCZ and South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) and neighboring continents. The regional patterns of tropical rainfall diurnal cycles are specified in the Amazon, Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, Calcutta, Bay of Bengal, Malaysia, and northern Australia. Limited validations for the results include comparisons of 1) the PERSIANN-derived diurnal cycle of rainfall at Rondonia, Brazil, with that derived from the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) radar data; 2) the PERSIANN diurnal cycle of rainfall over the western Pacific Ocean with that derived from the data of the optical rain gauges mounted on the TOGA-moored buoys: and 3) the monthly accumulations of rainfall samples from the orbital TMI and PR surface rainfall with the accumulations of concurrent PERSIANN estimates. These comparisons indicate that the PERSIANN-derived diurnal patterns at the selected resolutions produce estimates that are similar in magnitude and phase.},

abstract = {Land surface models (LSMs) are widely used to study the continental part of the water cycle. However, even though their accuracy is increasing, inherent model uncertainties can not be avoided. In the meantime, remotely sensed observations of the continental water cycle variables such as soil moisture, lakes and river elevations are more frequent and accurate. Therefore, those two different types of information can be combined, using data assimilation techniques to reduce a model's uncertainties in its state variables or/and in its input parameters. The objective of this study is to present a data assimilation platform that assimilates into the large-scale ISBA-CTRIP LSM a punctual river discharge product, derived from ENVISAT nadir altimeter water elevation measurements and rating curves, over the whole Amazon basin. To deal with the scale difference between the model and the observation, the study also presents an initial development for a localization treatment that allows one to limit the impact of observations to areas close to the observation and in the same hydrological network. This assimilation platform is based on the ensemble Kalman filter and can correct either the CTRIP river water storage or the discharge. Root mean square error (RMSE) compared to gauge discharges is globally reduced until 21% and at {\'{O}}bidos, near the outlet, RMSE is reduced by up to 52% compared to ENVISAT-based discharge. Finally, it is shown that localization improves results along the main tributaries.},

abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to examine the temporal and spatial variability of the troposphere over the Southern Hemisphere and, in the case of El Nino/Southern Oscillation, link it to fluctuations in the tropical oceans as well. In the time since the first volume on Southern Hemisphere meteorology appeared in 1972, it has been possible to examine in much more detail the variability of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) atmosphere, due to the vast improvements in the amount and quality of data that have since become available. Despite this progress, vast regions of the southern oceans remain very poorly observed. Fortunately, advances in remote sensing by satellite have done much to fill in some of the existing gaps in the ship-and ground-based observing network. We deal specifically here with interannual (IA) and intraseasonal (IS) variability, with respect to the mean state of the atmosphere as outlined in sections 1 and 2. As discussed in those sections, over most regions the SH atmosphere displays a lower amplitude mean seasonal cycle than does the Northern Hemisphere, where continental effects result in a much larger first annual harmonic in the meridional temperature gradient and circulation strength. This is also reflected in less of a seasonal dependence in the variability of the SH troposphere. Despite the dominance of ocean over the SH, however, continental effects, orography, and forcing from the Tropics still produce substantial zonal asymmetries in both the time-mean flow and statistics of IA and IS variability.},

abstract = {Modern hydrology relies on multiple sources of information combined with climatological, hydrological and glaciological data. These data can be collected through various sources such as private initiatives by companies, research programs, and both national and international organisms. They also vary by types, e.g., in situ measurements, satellite, reanalysis and simulated data. Recently the ANDEX research project, as a GEWEX regional program, was created to understand the processes related to the hydrological cycle and energy fluxes in the Andean region from Colombia to Patagonia. It is quite challenging to carry out this program given the complex orography and diversity of climates from tropical to sub-polar climates. This review article is a compilation of the various databases that are useful for hydrometeorological research in the South American Andes. The National Meteorological and Hydrological Services in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela and Argentina provide a large amount of data however the high-elevation areas are poorly instrumented and the number of stations varies greatly between the countries. National databases are only partially shared with the international bodies responsible for summarizing the existing data; this causes problems in term of data product assimilation. Across the entire continent, too few radiosondes are being used despite the fact that these data are crucial for validating and identifying problems in the atmospheric models. An increasing number of satellite data are available but it is difficult to assimilate them into the hydroclimatological models suited to the adjusted spatial and temporal resolutions. Specifically, for precipitation, we recommend merged products that account for the high spatial and temporal variability across the Andes. Finally, the international ANDEX program could be an excellent opportunity to increase the knowledge of the hydrological processes in the Andes.},

abstract = {The process whereby the spatially distributed runoff (generated through saturation/infiltration excesses, subsurface flow, etc.) travels over the hillslope and river network and becomes streamflow is generally referred to as "routing". In short, routing is a runoff-to-streamflow process, and the streamflow in rivers is the response to runoff integrated in both time and space. Here we develop a methodology to invert the routing process, i.e., to derive the spatially distributed runoff from streamflow (e.g., measured at gauge stations) by inverting an arbitrary linear routing model using fixed interval smoothing. We refer to this streamflow-to-runoff process as "inverse routing". Inversion experiments are performed using both synthetically generated and real streamflow measurements over the Ohio River basin. Results show that inverse routing can effectively reproduce the spatial field of runoff and its temporal dynamics from sufficiently dense gauge measurements, and the inversion performance can also be strongly affected by low gauge density and poor data quality. <br><br> The runoff field is the only component in the terrestrial water budget that cannot be directly measured, and all previous studies used streamflow measurements in its place. Consequently, such studies are limited to scales where the spatial and temporal difference between the two can be ignored. Inverse routing provides a more sophisticated tool than traditional methods to bridge this gap and infer fine-scale (in both time and space) details of runoff from aggregated measurements.

abstract = {Rainfall measurements by conventional raingauges provide relatively accurate estimates at a few points of a region. The actual rainfield can be approximated by interpolating the available raingauge data to the remaining of the area of interest. In places with relatively low gauge density such interpolated rainfields will be very rough estimates of the actual events. This is especially true for tropical regions where most rainfall has a convective origin with high spatial variability at the daily level. Estimates of rainfall by remote sensing can be very useful in regions such as the Amazon basin, where raingauge density is very low and rainfall highly variable. This paper evaluates the rainfall estimates of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite over the Tapaj{\'{o}}s river basin, a major tributary of the Amazon. Three-hour TRMM rainfall estimates were aggregated to daily values and were compared with catch of ground-level precipitation gauges on a daily basis after interpolating both data to a regular grid. Both daily TRMM and raingauge-interpolated rainfields were then used as input to a large-scale hydrological model for the whole basin; the calculated hydrographs were then compared to observations at several streamgauges along the river Tapajos and its main tributaries. Results of the rainfield comparisons showed that satellite estimates can be a practical tool for identifying damaged or aberrant raingauges at a basin-wide scale. Results of the hydrological modeling showed that TRMM-based calculated hydrographs are comparable with those obtained using raingauge data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {AbstractThis study addresses in general terms the problem of the optimal combination of multiple observation datasets. Only satellite-retrieved geophysical parameter datasets are considered here (not the raw satellite observations). This study focuses on the terrestrial water cycle and presents methodologies to obtain a coherent dataset of four water cycle key components: precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and terrestrial water storage. Various innovative “integration” methodologies are introduced: simple weighting (SW), constrained linear (CL), optimal interpolation (OI), and neural networks (NN). The term “integration” will be used here, not “assimilation,” as no model will be included in the data fusion process. A simple postprocessing filtering (PF) step can be used to impose the water cycle budget closure after the integration method. It is shown that this constraint actually improves the estimation of the water cycle components. The integration techniques are tested using real observation da...},

abstract = {Anecdotes from local residents and modeling studies suggest that deforestation may delay the onset of the rainy season (O) in western Brazil, but detection studies using climatological time series are not available. Here we investigate trends in O in the state of Rondonia, Brazil, a region that has been continuously deforested since the 1970s. Daily rainfall data from 16 station time series, spanning periods of at least 25 years, with five covering more than 30 years, are used. We define O as the first day after 1 September with rainfall greater than 20 mm d−1 . A t test indicates that for stations that lie inside the major deforested area, O has significantly shifted to, on average, 11 days (and up to 18 days) later in the year over the last three decades. However, for stations that lie in areas that have not been heavily deforested, O has not shifted significantly. Nonparametric and parametric trend analyses all gave similar results for the change of O with time, and all of the statistically significant results indicated a delay in O. Twentyfive percent (four) of the stations analyzed showed a marked shift in timing of O: these stations are located inside deforested areas, primarily near the BR 364 highway that crosses Rondonia. Delayed onset may be a result of land use change, and this signal may strengthen in future: current delaying trends may be as great as 0.6 days per year, and after 30 years of deforestation the onset of the rainy season is expected to be 18 days later.},

abstract = {Although it is well established that transpiration contributes much of the water for rainfall over Amazonia, it remains unclear whether transpiration helps to drive or merely responds to the seasonal cycle of rainfall. Here, we use multiple independent satellite datasets to show that rainforest transpiration enables an increase of shallow convection that moistens and destabilizes the atmosphere during the initial stages of the dry-to-wet season transition. This shallow convection moisture pump (SCMP) preconditions the atmosphere at the regional scale for a rapid increase in rain-bearing deep convection, which in turn drives moisture convergence and wet season onset 2–3 mo before the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Aerosols produced by late dry season biomass burning may alter the efficiency of the SCMP. Our results highlight the mechanisms by which interactions among land surface processes, atmospheric convection, and biomass burning may alter the timing of wet season onset and provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how deforestation extends the dry season and enhances regional vulnerability to drought.},

abstract = {We present global, vertical profile estimates of the HDO/H2O ratio from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura satellite. We emphasize in this paper the estimation approach and error characterization, which are critical to determining the very small absolute concentration of HDO relative to H2O and its uncertainty. These estimates were made from TES nadir-viewing (downlooking) thermal infrared spectral radiances observed on 20 September 2004. Profiles of HDO and H2O are simultaneously estimated from the observed radiances and a profile of the ratio is then calculated. This simultaneous, or "joint," estimate is regularized with an a priori covariance matrix that includes expected correlations between HDO and H2O. This approach minimizes errors in the profile of the HDO/H2O ratio that are due to overlapping HDO and H2O spectroscopic lines. Under clear-sky conditions in the tropics, TES estimates of the HDO/H2O ratio are sensitive to the distribution of the actual ratio between the surface and about 300 hPa with peak sensitivity at 700 hPa. The sensitivity decreases with latitude through its dependence on temperature and water amount. We estimate a precision of approximately 1% to 2% for the ratio of the HDO/H2O tropospheric densities; however, there is possibly a bias of approximately 5% in the ratio due to the HDO spectroscopic line strengths. These global observations clearly show increased isotopic depletion of water vapor at higher latitudes as well as increased depletion in the upper troposphere versus the lower troposphere.

abstract = {During the past decades large-scale models have been developed to simulate global and continental terrestrial water cycles. It is an open question whether thesemodels are suitable to capture hydrological drought, in terms of runoff, on a global scale. Amultimodel ensemble analysis was carried out to evaluate if 10 such large-scalemodels agree on major drought events during the second half of the twentieth century. Time series of monthly precipitation, monthly total runofffrom 10 global hydrologicalmodels, and their ensemblemedian have been used to identify drought. Temporal development of area in drought for various regions across the globe was investigated. Model spread was largest in regions with low runoffand smallest in regions with high runoff. In vast regions, correlation between runoffdrought derived from the models and meteorological drought was found to be low. This indicated that models add information to the signal derived from precipitation and that runoffdrought cannot directly be determined from precipitation data alone in global drought analyses with a constant aggregation period. However, duration and spatial extent of major drought events differed between models. Some models showed a fast runoffresponse to rainfall, which led to deviations from reported drought events in slowly responding hydrological systems. By using an ensemble of models, this fast runoffresponse was partly overcome and delay in drought propagating from meteorological drought to drought in runoffwas included. Finally, an ensemble of models also allows for consideration of uncertainty associated with individual model structures. ? 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Amazon tropical forests and the semiarid Northeast Brazil (NEB) region have registered very severe droughts during the last two decades, with a frequency that may have exceeded natural climate variability. Severe droughts impact the physiological response of Amazon forests, decreasing the availability to absorb atmospheric CO2, as well as biodiversity and increasing risk of fires. Droughts on this region also affect population by isolating them due to anomalous low river levels. Impacts of droughts over NEB region are related to water and energy security and subsistence agriculture. Most drought episodes over Amazonia and NEB are associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o (EN) events, anomalous warming over the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), and even an overlapping among them. However, not all the dry episodes showed a large-scale pattern linked to a canonical EN event or warm TNA episodes. For instance, dry episodes linked to EN events present distinct spatial patterns of precipitation anomalies depending on EN type (Central-Pacific vs. Eastern-Pacific EN), and NEB region experienced a severe drought in 2012 that is not attributed to EN or warm TNA events. Even in the case of the strong EN in 2015/16, some regional impacts have not been explained by EN contribution. This paper discusses the effects of CP and EP EN events, and the role of warm TNA events on tropical Walker and Hadley circulation leading to drought over Amazonia and NEB regions.},

Our analysis is based on comprehensive discharge, rainfall and average suspended sediment data sets. Particular attention is paid to the 2010–11 hydrological year, when an unprecedented abrupt transition from the extreme September 2010 drought (8300 m 3 s −1 ) to one of the four highest discharges in April 2011 (49 500 m 3 s −1 ) was recorded at Tamshiyacu (Amazonas River). This unusual transition is also observed in average suspended sediments. Years with a rapid increase in discharge are characterized by negative sea surface temperature anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific during austral summer, corresponding to a La Ni{\~{n}}a-like mode. It originates a geopotential height wave train over the subtropical South Pacific and southeastern South America, with a negative anomaly along the southern Amazon and the southeastern South Atlantic convergence zone region. As a consequence, the monsoon flux is retained over the Amazon and a strong convergence of humidity occurs in the Peruvian Amazon basin, favoring high rainfall and discharge. These features are also reported during the 2010–11 austral summer, when an intense La Ni{\~{n}}a event characterized the equatorial Pacific.},

@article{Trenberth2011,
abstract = {There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: it never rains but it pours! This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid- to high latitudes: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. more bang for the buck, atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Ni o a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.},

By setting an exact formula for each index and using specially designed software, analyses done in different countries have been combined seamlessly. This has enabled the presentation of the most up-to-date and comprehensive global picture of trends in extreme temperature and precipitation indices using results from a number of workshops held in data-sparse regions and high-quality station data supplied by numerous scientists world wide. Seasonal and annual indices for the period 1951-2003 were gridded. Trends in the gridded fields were computed and tested for statistical significance. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature. Over 70% of the global land area sampled showed a significant decrease in the annual occurrence of cold nights and a significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm nights. Some regions experienced a more than doubling of these indices. This implies a positive shift in the distribution of daily minimum temperature throughout the globe. Daily maximum temperature indices showed similar changes but with smaller magnitudes. Precipitation changes showed a widespread and significant increase, but the changes are much less spatially coherent compared with temperature change. Probability distributions of indices derived from approximately 200 temperature and 600 precipitation stations, with near-complete data for 1901-2003 and covering a very large region of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (and parts of Australia for precipitation) were analyzed for the periods 1901-1950, 1951-1978 and 1979-2003. Results indicate a significant warming throughout the 20th century. Differences in temperature indices distributions are particularly pronounced between the most recent two periods and for those indices related to minimum temperature. An analysis of those indices for which seasonal time series are available shows that these changes occur for all seasons although they are generally least pronounced for September to November. Precipitation indices show a tendency toward wetter conditions throughout the 20th century.},

abstract = {An atmospheric general circulation model simulation for 1948-97 of the water budgets for the MacKenzie, Mississippi, and Amazon River basins is presented. In addition to the water budget, passive tracers are included to identify the geographic sources of water for the basins, and the analysis focuses on the mechanisms contributing to precipitation recycling in each basin. While each basin's precipitation recycling has a strong dependency on evaporation during the mean annual cycle, the interannual variability of the recycling shows important relationships with the atmospheric circulation. The MacKenzie River basin recycling has only a weak interannual correspondence with evaporation, where the variations in zonal moisture transport from the Pacific Ocean can affect the basin water cycle. On the other hand, the Mississippi River basin precipitation and recycling have strong interannual correlation on evaporation. The evaporation is related to the moist and shallow planetary boundary layer that provides moisture for convection at the cloud base. At global scales, high precipitation recycling is also found to be partly correlated to warm SSTs in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The Amazon River basin evaporation exhibits small interannual variations, so the interannual variations of precipitation recycling are related to atmospheric moisture transport from the tropical South Atlantic Ocean. Increasing SSTs over the 50-yr period are causing increased easterly transport across the basin. As moisture transport increases, the Amazon precipitation recycling decreases (without real-time varying vegetation changes). In addition, precipitation recycling from a bulk diagnostic method is compared to the passive tracer method used in the analysis. While the mean values of the different recycling methods are different, the interannual variations are comparable between each method. The methods also exhibit similar relationships to the terms of the basin-scale water budgets. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {With a growing number of available datasets especially from satellite remote sensing, there is a great opportunity to improve our knowledge of the state of the hydrological processes via data assimilation. Observations can be assimilated into numerical models using dynamics and data-driven approaches. The present study aims to assess these assimilation frameworks for integrating different sets of satellite measurements in a hydrological context. To this end, we implement a traditional data assimilation system based on the Square Root Analysis (SQRA) filtering scheme and the newly developed data-driven Kalman-Takens technique to update the water components of a hydrological model with the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage (TWS), and soil moisture products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) in a 5-day temporal scale. While SQRA relies on a physical model for forecasting, the Kalman-Takens only requires a trajectory of the system based on past data. We are particularly interested in testing both methods for assimilating different combination of the satellite data. In most of the cases, simultaneous assimilation of the satellite data by either standard SQRA or Kalman-Takens achieves the largest improvements in the hydrological state, in terms of the agreement with independent in-situ measurements. Furthermore, the Kalman-Takens approach performs comparably well to dynamical method at a fraction of the computational cost.},

abstract = {Satellite derived rainfall products are useful for drought and flood early warning and overcome the problem of sparse, unevenly distributed and erratic rain gauge observations, provided their accuracy is well known. Mozambique is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events such as major droughts and floods and thus, an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different rainfall products is valuable. Three dekadal (10-day) gridded satellite rainfall products (TAMSAT African Rainfall Climatology And Time-series (TARCAT) v2.0, Famine Early Warning System NETwork (FEWS NET) Rainfall Estimate (RFE) v2.0, and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)) are compared to independent gauge data (2001-2012). This is done using pairwise comparison statistics to evaluate the performance in estimating rainfall amounts and categorical statistics to assess rain-detection capabilities. The analysis was performed for different rainfall categories, over the seasonal cycle and for regions dominated by different weather systems. Overall, satellite products overestimate low and underestimate high dekadal rainfall values. The RFE and CHIRPS products perform as good, generally outperforming TARCAT on the majority of statistical measures of skill. TARCAT detects best the relative frequency of rainfall events, while RFE underestimates and CHIRPS overestimates the rainfall events frequency. Differences in products performance disappear with higher rainfall and all products achieve better results during the wet season. During the cyclone season, CHIRPS shows the best results, while RFE outperforms the other products for lower dekadal rainfall. Products blending thermal infrared and passive microwave imagery perform better than infrared only products and particularly when meteorological patterns are more complex, such as over the coastal, central and south regions of Mozambique, where precipitation is influenced by frontal systems.},

The horizontal resolution is about 80 km and the time frequency is 3-hourly.

The quality of ERA-Interim/Land is assessed by comparing with ground-based and remote sensing observations. In particular, estimates of soil moisture, snow depth, surface albedo, turbulent latent and sensible fluxes, and river discharges are verified against a large number of site measurements. ERA-Interim/Land provides a global integrated and coherent estimate of soil moisture and snow water equivalent, which can also be used for the initialization of numerical weather prediction and climate models.},

abstract = {We assess the water balance of the Brazilian Cerrado based on remotely sensed estimates of precipitation (TRMM), evapotranspiration (MOD16), and terrestrial water storage (GRACE) for the period from 2003 to 2010. Uncertainties for each remotely sensed data set were computed, the budget closure was evaluated using measured discharge data for the three largest river basins in the Cerrado, and the Mann-Kendall test was used to evaluate temporal trends in the water balance components and measured river discharge. The results indicate an overestimation of discharge data, due mainly to the overestimation of rainfall by TRMM version 6. However, better results were obtained when the new release of TRMM 3B42 v7 was used instead. Our results suggest that there have been (a) significant increases in average annual evapotranspiration over the entire Cerrado of 51 ± 15 mm yr-1, (b) terrestrial water storage increases of 11 ± 6 mm yr-1 in the northeast region of the Brazilian Cerrado, and (c) runoff decreases of 72 ± 11 mm yr-1 in isolated spots and in the western part of the State of Mato Grosso. Although complete water budget closure from remote sensing remains a significant challenge due to uncertainties in the data, it provides a useful way to evaluate trends in major water balance components over large regions, identify dry periods, and assess changes in water balance due to land cover and land use change.},

abstract = {The One-Degree Daily (1DD) technique is described for producing globally complete daily estimates of precipitation on a 1° × 1° lat/long grid from currently available observational data. Where possible (40°N-40°S), the Threshold-Matched Precipitation Index (TMPI) provides precipitation estimates in which the 3-hourly infrared brightness temperatures (IR Tb) are compared with a threshold and all "cold" pixels are given a single precipitation rate. This approach is an adaptation ot the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Precipitation Index, but for the TMPI the IR Tb threshold and conditional rain rate are set locally by month from Special Sensor Microwave Imager-based precipitation frequency and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) satellite-gauge (SG) combined monthly precipitation estimate, respectively. At higher latitudes the 1DD features a rescaled daily Television and Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) precipitation. The frequency of rain days in the TOVS is scaled down to match that in the TMPI at the data boundaries, and the resulting nonzero TOVS values are scaled locally to sum to the SG (which is a globally complete monthly product). The GPCP has approved the 1DD as an official product, and data have been produced for 1997 through 1999, with production continuing a few months behind real time (to allow access to monthly input data). The time series of the daily 1DD global images shows good continuity in time and across the data boundaries. Various examples are shown to illustrate uses. Validation for individual gridbox values shows a very high mean absolute error, but it improves quickly when users perform time/space averaging according to their own requirements.},

We examined projections of climate change on discharge and inundation extent in the Amazon basin using the regional hydrological model MGB-IPH with 1-dimensional river hydraulic and water storage simulation in floodplains. Future projections (2070–2099) were obtained from five GCMs from IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report CMIP5. Climate projections have uncertainty and results from different climate models did not agree in total Amazon flooded area or discharge anomalies along the main stem river. Overall, model runs agree better with wetter (drier) conditions over western (eastern) Amazon. Results indicate that increased mean and maximum river discharge for large rivers draining the Andes in the northwest contributes to increased mean and maximum discharge and inundation extent over Peruvian floodplains and Solim{\~{o}}es River (annual mean-max: +9 % - +18.3 %) in western Amazonia. Decreased river discharges (mostly dry season) are projected for eastern basins, and decreased inundation extent at low water (annual min) in the central (−15.9 %) and lower Amazon (−4.4 %).},

abstract = {Continental moisture recycling is a crucial process of the South American climate system. In particular, evapotranspiration from the Amazon basin contributes substantially to precipitation regionally as well as over other remote regions such as the La Plata basin. Here we present an in-depth analysis of South American moisture recycling mechanisms. In particular, we quantify the importance of cascading moisture recycling (CMR), which describes moisture transport between two locations on the continent that involves re-evaporation cycles along the way. Using an Eulerian atmospheric moisture tracking model forced by a combination of several historical climate data sets, we were able to construct a complex network of moisture recycling for South America. Our results show that CMR contributes about 9-10% to the total precipitation over South America and 17-18% over the La Plata basin. CMR increases the fraction of total precipitation over the La Plata basin that originates from the Amazon basin from 18-23 to 24-29% during the wet season. We also show that the south-western part of the Amazon basin is not only a direct source of rainfall over the La Plata basin, but also a key intermediary region that distributes moisture originating from the entire Amazon basin towards the La Plata basin during the wet season. Our results suggest that land use change in this region might have a stronger impact on downwind rainfall than previously thought. Using complex network analysis techniques, we find the eastern side of the sub-tropical Andes to be a key region where CMR pathways are channeled. This study offers a better understanding of the interactions between the vegetation and the atmosphere on the water cycle, which is needed in a context of land use and climate change in South America.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the representation of the air surface temperature and precipitation using high spatiotemporal simulations (3 km–1 h) of the WRF3.7.1 model in the central Peruvian area. It covers, from east to west, the coastal zone, the western slope of the Andes, the Andean Mantaro basin (500–5000 masl), and the Andes-Amazon transition region in the eastern Andes. The study covers the January months from 2004 to 2008. Three experiments were conducted using different topography and land use data sources: (1) a control simulation using the default WRF topography and land use datasets from the United States Geological Survey (USGS); (2) a simulation changing only the topography by using the SRTM topography dataset; and (3) a simulation changing the land use data of (2) by a new dataset adapted from Eva et al. (2004). SRTM topography performed better than the control simulation for representing the actual altitudes of 57 meteorological stations that were used for precipitation and surface air temperature data. As a result, the simulations of experiments (2) and (3) produced lower bias values than that of (1). Topography change (experiment (2)) showed improvements in temperature bias that were directly associated with linear modifications of -5.6 and -6.7 °C∙km−1 in minimum and maximum temperature, respectively. Increasing (decreasing) precipitation with topography or land use change was clearly controlled by changes in the moisture flux patterns and its convergence (divergence) in the Andes-Amazon transition. On the western slope, precipitation increase could be associated with the increase in easterly flow by the smaller altitudes of the Andes mountains in SRTM topography and by increasing evaporation with new land use. Inside the Mantaro Basin, low level moisture flux seems to control the rainfall changes. Overall, relative changes (positive or negative) in precipitation due to topography or land use change could reach values above 25%.},

abstract = {The new IMERG and GSMaP-v6 satellite rainfall estimation (SRE) products from the Global Precipitation Monitoring (GPM) mission have been available since January 2015. With a finer grid box of 0.1°, these products should provide more detailed information than their latest widely-adapted (relatively coarser spatial scale, 0.25°) counterpart. Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation version 6 (GSMaP-v6) assessment is done by comparing their rainfall estimations with 247 rainfall gauges from 2014 to 2016 in Bolivia. The comparisons were done on annual, monthly and daily temporal scales over the three main national watersheds (Amazon, La Plata and TDPS), for both wet and dry seasons to assess the seasonal variability and according to different slope classes to assess the topographic influence on SREs. To observe the potential enhancement in rainfall estimates brought by these two recently released products, the widely-used TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product is also considered in the analysis. The performances of all the products increase during the wet season. Slightly less accurate than TMPA, IMERG can almost achieve its main objective, which is to ensure TMPA rainfall measurements, while enhancing the discretization of rainy and non-rainy days. It also provides the most accurate estimates among all products over the Altiplano arid region. GSMaP-v6 is the least accurate product over the region and tends to underestimate rainfall over the Amazon and La Plata regions. Over the Amazon and La Plata region, SRE potentiality is related to topographic features with the highest bias observed over high slope regions. Over the TDPS watershed, the high rainfall spatial variability with marked wet and arid regions is the main factor influencing SREs.},

The determination of the distribution of these water mass sources over networks of juxtaposed triangular tiles was made using Kalman Filtering (KF) of daily GRACE geopotential difference observations that were reduced for isolating the continental hydrology contribution of the measured gravity field. Geopotential differences were obtained from the along-track K-Band Range Rate (KBRR) measurements according to the method of energy integral. The recovery approach was validated by inverting synthetic GRACE geopotential differences simulated using GLDAS/WGHM global hydrology model outputs. Series of daily regional and global KF solutions were estimated from real GRACE KBRR data for the period 2003–2012. They provide a realistic description of hydrological fluxes at monthly time scales, which are consistent with classical spherical harmonics and mascons solutions provided by the GRACE official centers but also give an intra-month/daily continuity of these variations.</p>},

abstract = {Increased energy demand has led to plans for building many new dams in the western Amazon, mostly in the Andean region. Historical data and mechanistic scenarios are used to examine potential impacts above and below six of the largest dams planned for the region, including reductions in downstream sediment and nutrient supplies, changes in downstream flood pulse, changes in upstream and downstream fish yields, reservoir siltation, greenhouse gas emissions and mercury contamination. Together, these six dams are predicted to reduce the supply of sediments, phosphorus and nitrogen from the Andean region by 69, 67 and 57% and to the entire Amazon basin by 64, 51 and 23%, respectively. These large reductions in sediment and nutrient supplies will have major impacts on channel geomorphology, floodplain fertility and aquatic productivity. These effects will be greatest near the dams and extend to the lowland floodplains. Attenuation of the downstream flood pulse is expected to alter the survival, phenology and growth of floodplain vegetation and reduce fish yields below the dams. Reservoir filling times due to siltation are predicted to vary from 106–6240 years, affecting the storage performance of some dams. Total CO2 equivalent carbon emission from 4 Andean dams was expected to average 10 Tg y-1 during the first 30 years of operation, resulting in a MegaWatt weighted Carbon Emission Factor of 0.139 tons C MWhr-1. Mercury contamination in fish and local human populations is expected to increase both above and below the dams creating significant health risks. Reservoir fish yields will compensate some downstream losses, but increased mercury contamination could offset these benefits.},

abstract = {The seasonal cycle of the intraseasonal (IS) variability of precipitation in South America is described through the analysis of bandpass filtered outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies. The analysis is discriminated between short (10–30 days) and long (30–90 days) intraseasonal timescales. The seasonal cycle of the 30–90-day IS variability can be well described by the activity of first leading pattern (EOF1) computed separately for the wet season (October–April) and the dry season (May–September). In agreement with previous works, the EOF1 spatial distribution during the wet season is that of a dipole with centers of actions in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) and southeastern South America (SESA), while during the dry season, only the last center is discernible. In both seasons, the pattern is highly influenced by the activity of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). Moreover, EOF1 is related with a tropical zonal-wavenumber-1 structure superposed with coherent wave trains extended along the South Pacific during the wet season, while during the dry season the wavenumber-1 structure is not observed. The 10–30-day IS variability of OLR in South America can be well represented by the activity of the EOF1 computed through considering all seasons together, a dipole but with the stronger center located over SESA. While the convection activity at the tropical band does not seem to influence its activity, there are evidences that the atmospheric variability at subtropical-extratropical regions might have a role. Subpolar wavetrains are observed in the Pacific throughout the year and less intense during DJF, while a path of wave energy dispersion along a subtropical wavetrain also characterizes the other seasons. Further work is needed to identify the sources of the 10–30-day-IS variability in South America.},

A critical perspective of mitigation of drought and flood policies in Amazonia suggests that they have been mostly ineffective in reducing vulnerability for the majority of the population, constituting, perhaps, exam-ples of maladaptation via the undermining of resilience.},

abstract = {A terrestrial ecosystem model (integrated biosphere simulator (IBIS)) and a hydrological routing algorithm (HYDRA) are used in conjunction with long time series climate data to simulate the river discharge and flooded area of the Amazon/Tocantins River basin over the last 60 years. Evaluating the results of this modeling exercise over the entire basin yields three major results: (1) Observations at 121 stations throughout the basin show that discharge is well simulated for most tributaries originating in Brazil. However, the discharge is consistently underestimated, by greater than 20%, for tributaries draining regions outside of Brazil and the main stem of the Amazon. The discharge underestimation is most likely a result of underestimated precipitation in the data set used as model input. (2) A new flooding algorithm within HYDRA captures the magnitude and timing of the river height and flooded area in relatively good agreement with observations, particularly downstream of the confluence of the Negro and Solimoes Rivers. (3) Climatic variability strongly impacts the hydrology of the basin. Specifically, we find that short (similar to3-4 years) and long (similar to28 years) modes of precipitation variability drive spatial and temporal variability in river discharge and flooded area throughout the Amazon/Tocantins River basins.},

abstract = {Long-term gridded precipitation products are crucial for several applications in hydrology, agriculture and climate sciences. Currently available precipitation products suffer from space and time inconsistency due to the non-uniform density of ground networks and the difficulties in merging multiple satellite sensors. The recent "bottom-up" approach that exploits satellite soil moisture observations for estimating rainfall through the SM2RAIN (Soil Moisture to Rain) algorithm is suited to build a consistent rainfall data record as a single polar orbiting satellite sensor is used. Here we exploit the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on board three Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites, launched in 2006, 2012, and 2018, as part of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Polar System programme. The continuity of the scatterometer sensor is ensured until the mid-2040s through the MetOp Second Generation Programme. Therefore, by applying the SM2RAIN algorithm to ASCAT soil moisture observations, a long-term rainfall data record will be obtained, starting in 2007 and lasting until the mid-2040s. The paper describes the recent improvements in data pre-processing, SM2RAIN algorithm formulation, and data post-processing for obtaining the SM2RAIN-ASCAT quasi-global (only over land) daily rainfall data record at a 12.5 km spatial sampling from 2007 to 2018. The quality of the SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record is assessed on a regional scale through comparison with high-quality ground networks in Europe, the United States, India, and Australia. Moreover, an assessment on a global scale is provided by using the triple-collocation (TC) technique allowing us also to compare these data with the latest, fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5), the Early Run version of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), and the gauge-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) products. Results show that the SM2RAIN-ASCAT rainfall data record performs relatively well at both a regional and global scale, mainly in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) when compared to other products. Specifically, the SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record provides performance better than IMERG and GPCC in data-scarce regions of the world, such as Africa and South America. In these areas, we expect larger benefits in using SM2RAIN-ASCAT for hydrological and agricultural applications. The limitations of the SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record consist of the underestimation of peak rainfall events and the presence of spurious rainfall events due to high-frequency soil moisture fluctuations that might be corrected in the future with more advanced bias correction techniques. The SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3405563 (Brocca et al., 2019) (recently extended to the end of August 2019).},

In the central part of the lowlands, a La Ni{\~{n}}a/dry signal is observed during the peak of the rainy season (February) and around wintertime (May and September). Going toward the Andes and on the foothills up to 1500 masl, no ENSO signal has been found. On the median slopes of the Zongo valley, between 1800 and 3500 m, a strong Ni{\~{n}}o/dry signal is depicted on an annual timescale and during summer. In February, a Ni{\~{n}}a/wet signal is also significant. Going westward through the high Andes and the eastern Altiplano, this signal weakens. On the western edge of the Altiplano, an El Ni{\~{n}}o/dry and La Ni{\~{n}}a/wet signals are clearly identified. In the central lowlands and on the western Altiplano, ENSO indexes account for nearly 25% of rainfall variability, and for as much as 50% along the median slopes of the eastern Cordillera, in the Zongo valley. This finding deserves further study as previous researches have shown that in the Andes the best relationship between rainfall and equatorial Pacific sea-surface temperature (SST) is in the westem Altiplano, far from the Amazonian source of moisture.

abstract = {Reliable precipitation information provided by rain gauge networks is invaluable for applications ranging from climatological studies to validation of remote sensing rainfall estimates. Daily precipitation data from 235 tipping bucket gauges in the Legal Brazilian Amazon are quality controlled for the period 1998-2009 by comparing precipitation time series from individual rain gauges with neighboring stations. Within a geostatistical framework, optimal distances for the comparison between stations are identified while considering the density of the network and the spatial structure of the precipitation. The number of rain gauges used as neighboring rain gauges varies between 2 and 57. Each gauge station is compared to nearby gauge stations using fourteen climate and statistical indicators. A proposed variability index allows for the detection of 'suspicious' precipitation data before more detailed analysis of the nature of the issue and the time period of concern in the time series. The internal consistency of the database is examined through the use of variograms and cross validation. The sensitivity of the effectiveness of the quality control procedure to the comparison distance is examined. These results are positive and this demonstrates that the spatial structure of daily rainfall is better sampled. The cross validation confirms that the quality control procedures improved the consistency of the database. Finally, the spatial consistency of the rainfall database is assessed through a classification of the seasonal regimes in the Legal Brazilian Amazon.},

abstract = {Although previous studies have considered the long-term variability of precipitation and river discharge in the Amazon basin, other components of the hydrologic cycle, such as evapotranspiration and the transport of water vapor, have not received the same attention. This study examines the 20-year variability of the full hydrologic budget of the Amazon basin, using a 1976-1996 time series from the National Centers for Environmental Protection/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalyzed meteorological data set. Within this 20-year record, there is a statistically significant decreasing trend in the atmospheric transport of water vapor both into and out of the Amazon basin. This trend is associated with a general relaxation of the southeasterly trade winds, a weakening of the east-to-west pressure gradient, and a warming of the sea surface temperatures in the equatorial South Atlantic region. While the atmospheric transport of water vapor through the Amazon basin has decreased, the internal recycling of precipitation within the basin increased and basin-wide precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff have remained nearly constant. Even though basin-average precipitation and runoff have remained fairly stable, other components of the Amazon basin's hydrologic cycle have been altered significantly by large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation.

This study aims to evaluate the water budget of the Amazon basin based on several state-ofthe- art land surface model (LSM) outputs. Water budget variables (terrestrial water storage TWS, evapotranspiration ET, surface runoff R, and base flow B) are evaluated at the basin scale using both remote sensing and in situ data. Meteorological forcings at a 3-hourly time step and 18 spatial resolution were used to run 14 LSMs. Precipitation datasets that have been rescaled to matchmonthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) andGlobal Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) datasets and the daily Hydrologie du Bassin de l'Amazone (HYBAM) dataset were used to perform three experiments. The Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP) river routing scheme was forced with R and B and simulated discharges are compared against observations at 165 gauges. Simulated ET and TWS are compared against FLUXNET and MOD16A2 evapotranspiration datasets andGravity Recovery and ClimateExperiment (GRACE)TWSestimates in two subcatchments of main tributaries (Madeira and Negro Rivers).At the basin scale, simulated ET ranges from 2.39 to 3.26mmday-1 and a low spatial correlation between ET and precipitation indicates that evapotranspiration does not depend on water availability over most of the basin. Results also show that other simulated water budget components vary significantly as a function of both the LSM and precipitation dataset, but simulated TWS generally agrees with GRACE estimates at the basin scale. The best water budget simulations resulted from experiments using HYBAM, mostly explained by a denser rainfall gauge network and the rescaling at a finer temporal scale. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

It is an open question whether thesemodels are suitable to capture hydrological drought, in terms of runoff, on a global scale. Amultimodel ensemble analysis was carried out to evaluate if 10 such large-scalemodels agree on major drought events during the second half of the twentieth century. Time series of monthly precipitation, monthly total runofffrom 10 global hydrologicalmodels, and their ensemblemedian have been used to identify drought. Temporal development of area in drought for various regions across the globe was investigated. Model spread was largest in regions with low runoffand smallest in regions with high runoff. In vast regions, correlation between runoffdrought derived from the models and meteorological drought was found to be low. This indicated that models add information to the signal derived from precipitation and that runoffdrought cannot directly be determined from precipitation data alone in global drought analyses with a constant aggregation period. However, duration and spatial extent of major drought events differed between models. Some models showed a fast runoffresponse to rainfall, which led to deviations from reported drought events in slowly responding hydrological systems. By using an ensemble of models, this fast runoffresponse was partly overcome and delay in drought propagating from meteorological drought to drought in runoffwas included. Finally, an ensemble of models also allows for consideration of uncertainty associated with individual model structures. ? 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

The analysis was performed considering different rainfall categories, seasonality, and spatial context. The results show that the satellite product CHIRPS v.2 overestimates (underestimates) low (high) monthly rainfall values; although on the majority of numerical metrics of skill shows a good performance. This product, on the other hand, achieves better performance during the rainy season (April-September), significantly overestimating, however, the rainfall-events frequency. The product also shows best overall performance over flat and open regions (e.g., Los Llanos), where precipitation is influenced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone activity and local convective systems.},

@phdthesis{Bastiaanssen1995,
abstract = {The growing concern about environment has increased the number of land surface processes studies. Computer simulation models of land surface processes have been developed for a range of scales and with different levels of physical complexity. Because the interactions between soil, vegetation and atmosphere vary both spatially and temporally, regional evaporation in heterogeneous natural landscapes is difficult to predict by means of computer simulation models. Remote sensing measurements of land surface radiative properties offer however a means to indirectly measure land surface state conditions at a range of scales. A straightforward estimation of evaporation from radiative properties of the land surface is hampered by the fact that only a very few parameters of the classical flux-profile relationships can be estimated directly from remote sensing measurements. Moreover, the accuracy of surface temperature measurements necessary to solve flux-profile relationships is still poor. Inclusion of ground measurements is a possible solution, but the absence of such data on large scales and for heterogeneous land surfaces where these parameters are not measured, forms an immediate obstacle for the implementation of remote sensing algorithms. A Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) has been developed in a way that the need for collateral measurements is partly eliminated, a very accurate surface temperature map is no longer required (although it should be as good as possible) and a land use classification to relate surface temperature to evaporation is not needed. Each pixel is characterized by a surface hemisherical reflectance, surface temperature and a vegetation index. The methodology composes of multiple flux-profile relationships for small sub-areas. Although the concept has a physical basis, the parameters are estimated by empirical relationships, for instance a relationship between near-surface vertical air temperature difference and surface temperature forms an essential component in the estimation of the sensible heat flux density. The absolute surface energy balance terms are estimated on an instantaneous time basis. Temporal integration of instantaneous surface flux densities is feasible using the evaporative fraction (latent heat flux density/net available energy): The evaporative fraction remains fairly constant during daytime hours for both homogeneous and heterogeneous areas. A physical explanation for this is given. A bulk surface resistance of a heterogeneous landscape has been related analytically to canopy and bare soil evaporation resistances. Measurements in central Spain have shown that the evaporative fraction and bulk surface resistance are suitable indicators to describe areal patterns of near-surface soil water content. Although the bulk surface resistance has a distinct diurnal variation, it is much less affected by changes in net available energy and therefore preferred to describe the energy partitioning for longer time series (weeks, months). SEBAL has been validated with data available from regional evaporation projects in Egypt and Spain. The error of high resolution evaporative fraction estimations decreases from 20% to 10% at a scale of 1 km to 5 km respectively. The error of low resolution evaporative fraction images at a scale of 100 km is approximately 1 to 5 %. Hence, the error averages out if a larger set of pixels is considered. It is concluded that the uncertainty of evaporation in regional water balances and model studies can be substantially reduced by estimating evaporation with remote sensing measurements using the proposed SEBAL technique.},

abstract = {This study provides an updated analysis of the evolution of seasonal rainfall intensity in the Amazon basin, considering the 1981–2017 period and based on HOP (interpolated HYBAM observed precipitation) and CHIRPS (The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations) rainfall data sets. Dry and wet day frequencies as well as extreme percentiles are used in this analysis, producing the same results. Dry-day frequency (DDF) significantly increases in the Southern Amazon (p < 0.01), particularly during September–November (SON) in the Bolivian Amazon, central Peruvian Amazon and far southern Brazilian Amazon. Consistently, total rainfall in the southern Amazon during SON also shows a significant diminution (p < 0.05), estimated at 18%. The increase in SON DDF in the southern Amazon is related to a warming of the northern tropical Atlantic Ocean and a weakening of water vapour flux from the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The increase in DDF in the southern Amazon is related to enhanced wind subsidence (ascendance) over the 10°S–20°S (5°S–5°N) region and to a deficit (excess) of specific humidity at 1000–300 hPa south of 10°S (north of the 5°S), which suggest a reduction of deep convection over southern Amazonia. Subsidence over the southern Amazon shows a significant trend (p < 0.01), which can explain the significant increase in DDF. Wet-day frequency (WDF) significantly increases in the northern Amazon, particularly during the March–May (MAM) period (p < 0.01), producing an estimated rainfall increase during MAM of 17% (p < 0.01) between 1981 and 2017. Significant changes in both WDF and rainfall in northern Amazon have been detected in 1998 (p < 0.01). After 1998, the increase in MAM WDF and rainfall is explained by enhanced moisture flux from the tropical North Atlantic Ocean and an increase in deep convection over the northern and northwestern Amazon. These evolutions in DDF and WDF and in the tropical atmosphere occur simultaneously with an increase in sea surface temperature in the northern Atlantic Ocean, particularly after the mid-1990s. These results provide new insight into rainfall variability and climatic features related to increasing dry season length in southern Amazonia. Severe recent droughts may be associated with the increase in DDF in the South. In addition, the increase in MAM rainfall intensity in northern Amazon after 1998 may be associated with several historical floods that occurred after this date.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors. Data assimilation (DA) of satellite soil moisture (SM) observations represents a great opportunity for improving the ability of rainfall-runoffmodels in predicting river discharges. Many studies have been carried out so far demonstrating the possibility to reduce model prediction uncertainty by incorporating satellite SM observations. However, large discrepancies can be perceived between these studies with the result that successful DA is not only related to the quality of the satellite observations but can be significantly controlled by many methodological and morphoclimatic factors. In this article, through an experimental study carried out on the Tiber River basin in Central Italy, we explore how the catchment area, soil type, climatology, rescaling technique, observation and model error selection may affect the results of the assimilation and can be the causes of the apparent discrepancies obtained in the literature. The results show that: (i) DA of SM generally improves discharge predictions (with a mean efficiency of about 30%); (ii) unlike catchment area, the soil type and the catchment specific characteristics might have a remarkable influence on the results; (iii) simple rescaling techniques may perform equally well to more complex ones; (iv) an accurate quantification of the model error is paramount for a correct choice of the observation error and, (v) SM temporal variability has a stronger influence than the season itself. On this basis, we advise that DA of SM may be not a simple task and one should carefully test the optimality of the assimilation experiment prior to drawing any general conclusions.},

abstract = {Hydrological connectivity regulates the structure and function of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems and the provisioning of services that sustain local populations. This connectivity is increasingly being disrupted by the construction of dams, mining, land-cover changes, and global climate change. This review analyzes these drivers of degradation, evaluates their impacts on hydrological connectivity, and identifies policy deficiencies that hinder freshwater ecosystem protection. There are 154 large hydroelectric dams in operation today, and 21 dams under construction. The current trajectory of dam construction will leave only three free-flowing tributaries in the next few decades if all 277 planned dams are completed. Land-cover changes driven by mining, dam and road construction, agriculture and cattle ranching have already affected $\sim$20% of the Basin and up to $\sim$50% of riparian forests in some regions. Global climate change will likely exacerbate these impacts by creating warmer and dryer conditions, with less predictable rainfall and more extreme events (e.g., droughts and floods). The resulting hydrological alterations are rapidly degrading freshwater ecosystems, both independently and via complex feedbacks and synergistic interactions. The ecosystem impacts include biodiversity loss, warmer stream temperatures, stronger and more frequent floodplain fires, and changes to biogeochemical cycles, transport of organic and inorganic materials, and freshwater community structure and function. The impacts also include reductions in water quality, fish yields, and availability of water for navigation, power generation, and human use. This degradation of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems cannot be curbed presently because existing policies are inconsistent across the Basin, ignore cumulative effects, and overlook the hydrological connectivity of freshwater ecosystems. Maintaining the integrity of these freshwater ecosystems requires a basinwide research and policy framework to understand and manage hydrological connectivity across multiple spatial scales and jurisdictional boundaries.},

abstract = {The southern border of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the most sensitive areas to deforestation in Brazil. Pondering problems related to changes in land use, new issues are emerging, such as, climate change and its negative effects on the regional hydrological cycle. The higher frequency of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a seems to have strong influence on rainfall in Amazonia. They are becoming more lasting and intense in the course of the last 20 to 30 years compared to the past 100 years. This paper may confront the scientific knowledge of the relations of climate and water resources in Amazon with the points of vulnerability that anthropic societies present in the region. The impact of climate change is not uniformly borne by different regions and populations. Actually, individuals, sectors and systems are affected to varying degrees and, besides, they may be prejudiced to a greater or lesser extent. These impacts vary in magnitude and intensity in accordance with certain aspects, for instance, geographical location, time, the prevalent social, economic and environmental conditions and the infra-structure of a given location. A comprehensive description of these extreme climate events is one of the first steps to a regional vulnerability approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This paper reviews recent progress in the study and understanding of extreme seasonal events in the Amazon region, focusing on drought and floods. The review includes a history of droughts and floods in the past, in the present and some discussions on future extremes in the context of climate change and its impacts on the Amazon region. Several extreme hydrological events, some of them characterized as 'once in a century', have been reported in the Amazon region during the last decade. While abundant rainfall in various sectors of the basin has determined extreme floods along the river's main stem in 1953, 1989, 1999, 2009, 2012-2015, deficient rainfall in 1912, 1926, 1963, 1980, 1983, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2010 has caused anomalously low river levels, and an increase in the risk and number of fires in the region, with consequences for humans. This is consistent with changes in the variability of the hydrometeorology of the basin and suggests that extreme hydrological events have been more frequent in the last two decades. Some of these intense/reduced rainfalls and subsequent floods/droughts were associated (but not exclusively) with La Ni{\~{n}}a/El Ni{\~{n}}o events. In addition, moisture transport anomalies from the tropical Atlantic into Amazonia, and from northern to southern Amazonia alter the water cycle in the region year-to-year. We also assess the impacts of such extremes on natural and human systems in the region, considering ecological, economic and societal impacts in urban and rural areas, particularly during the recent decades. In the context of the future climate change, studies show a large range of uncertainty, but suggest that drought might intensify through the 21st century.},

A general framework is suggested. Data from a number of saturated land sites and open water sites in the absence of advection suggest a widely applicable formula for the relationship between sensible and latent heat fluxes. For drying land surfaces, we assume that the evaporation rate is given by the same formula for evaporation multiplied by a factor. This factor is found to remain at unity while an amount of water, varying from one site to another, is evaporated. Following this a linear decrease sets in, reducing the evaporation rate to zero after a further 5 cm of evaporation, the same at several sites examined.},

Only the after-real-time product incorporates gauge data at the present. The dataset covers the latitude band 50°N-S for the period from 1998 to the delayed present. Early validation results are as follows: the TMPA provides reasonable performance at monthly scales, although it is shown to have precipitation rate-dependent low bias due to lack of sensitivity to low precipitation rates over ocean in one of the input products [based on Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B)]. At finer scales the TMPA is successful at approximately reproducing the surface observation-based histogram of precipitation, as well as reasonably detecting large daily events. The TMPA, however, has lower skill in correctly specifying moderate and light event amounts on short time intervals, in common with other finescale estimators.

Here we present a new algo-rithm that automatically calculates river width from satellite-based water masks and flow direction maps. The Global Width Database for Large Rivers (GWD-LR) is developed by applying the algorithm to the SRTM Water Body Database and the HydroSHEDS flow direction map. Both bank-to-bank river width and effective river width excluding islands are calculated for river channels between 60S and 60N. The effective river width of GWD-LR is compared with existing river width databases for the Congo and Mississippi Rivers. The effective river width of the GWD-LR is slightly narrower compared to the existing databases, but the relative difference is within 620% for most river channels. As the river width of the GWD-LR is calculated along the river channels of the HydroSHEDS flow direction map, it is relatively straightforward to apply the GWD-LR to global and continental-scale river modeling.},

While the resulting product can be deemed as the best-available source of quality validation data, awareness of the limitations of such data sets is important to avoid extracting wrong or unsubstantiated conclusions when assessing climate model abilities. This paper provides guidance on the use of precipitation data sets for climate research, including model validation and verification for improving physical parameterizations.

Much of these data have been neglected by climate observation studies due to difficulties with calibration and data processing over such a long period.

This new record provides equal-angle gridded uniform observations of brightness temperatures every 3 h from 1980 to the present for most of the globe. We have demonstrated the multiple and diverse uses of the data for climate analysis made possible by GridSat data-from predicting drought and food security in Africa to the detailed and historical tracking of hurricanes. This only touches on some of the potential uses of GridSat. Accurate records of global atmospheric fields are essential for future research on climate change as well as the understanding of the planet's meteorology. By reconstructing past satellite data and combining them with current satellite observations, a seamless data record has been obtained for the study of Earth's atmospheric state. In addition, GridSat has given a wide range of users very easy access to this new data record.

abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is difficult to measure at the scales of climate models and climate variability. While satellite retrieval algorithms do exist, their accuracy is limited by the sparseness of in situ observations available for calibration and validation, which themselves may be unrepresentative of 500 m and larger scale satellite footprints and grid pixels. Here, we use a combination of satellite and ground-based observations to close the water budgets of seven continental scale river basins (Mackenzie, Fraser, Nelson, Mississippi, Tocantins, Danube, and Ubangi), estimating mean ET as a residual. For any river basin, ET must equal total precipitation minus net runoff minus the change in total terrestrial water storage (TWS), in order for mass to be conserved. We make use of precipitation from two global observation-based products, archived runoff data, and TWS changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. We demonstrate that while uncertainty in the water budget-based estimates of monthly ET is often too large for those estimates to be useful, the uncertainty in the mean annual cycle is small enough that it is practical for evaluating other ET products. Here, we evaluate five land surface model simulations, two operational atmospheric analyses, and a recent global reanalysis product based on our results. An important outcome is that the water budget-based ET time series in two tropical river basins, one in Brazil and the other in central Africa, exhibit a weak annual cycle, which may help to resolve debate about the strength of the annual cycle of ET in such regions and how ET is constrained throughout the year. The methods described will be useful for water and energy budget studies, weather and climate model assessments, and satellite-based ET retrieval optimization.

abstract = {Due to progressive erosion of the new Urucurituba Channel, the Amazon River has recently captured almost all discharge from the lower Araguari River (Amap{\'{a}}-AP, Brazil), which previously flowed directly to the Atlantic Ocean. These recent geomorphological changes have caused strong impacts on the landscape and hydrodynamic patterns near the Araguari River mouth, especially the alteration of the riverine drainage system and its water quality. Landsat images were used to assess the estuarine landscape morphodynamic, particularly the expansion of the Urucurituba Channel, 80 km from the Araguari River mouth, chronicling its connection to the Amazon River. The results suggest that the Urucurituba developed by headward migration across the Amazon delta; this is perhaps the first observation of estuarine distributary network development by headward channel erosion. The rate of Urucurituba Channel width increase has been ≈ 5 m/month since 2011, increasing drainage capacity of the channel. We also collected in situ hydrodynamic measurements and analyzed 17 water quality parameters. Having 2011 as baseline, the flowrate of Araguari River has been diverted by up to 98% through Urucurituba Channel, with substantial changes in net discharge recorded at 3 monitoring stations. Statistically significant differences in water quality (p < 0.05) were observed between 2011 and 2015, associated with the change in the flow pattern. Estuarine salinity and solids concentrations have increased. Overall, we demonstrate changes in landscape, hydrodynamics and water quality of the lower Araguari River.},

This paradigm imposes that errors are transferred from runoff to discharge, yet the analytical propagation of uncertainty from runoff to discharge has never been derived. Here we apply statistics to the continuity equation within a river network to derive two equations that propagate the mean and variance/covariance of runoff errors independently. We validate these equations in a case study of the rivers in the western United States and, for the first time, invert observed discharge errors for spatially distributed runoff errors. Our results suggest that the largest discharge error source is the joint variability of runoff errors across space, not the mean or amplitude of individual errors. Our findings significantly advance the science of error quantification in model-based estimates of river discharge.},

abstract = {The prominent Andes cordillera induces significant differences in climates between its eastern and western slopes. These climatic differences are largely reflected by contrasting vegetation and ice coverages but remain poorly documented. This study quantifies the abrupt changes of precipitation and cloud properties at both sides of the Andes south of 20°S by using surface daily precipitation and satellite (CloudSat and MODIS) data during the 2006-2016 period. Results show that the precipitation changes drastically and precipitating clouds can be of very different nature on each side of the Andes. In the tropical Andes (20-25°S), precipitation normally falls from a sole layer of thick stratiform and convective precipitating clouds during the warm semester, but the annual mean accumulation is about 10-100 times larger on the eastern than on the western slopes. A sole layer of low stratus clouds dominates over the Pacific coast, occasionally producing light rains, whereas high, thin, and non-precipitating clouds dominate most of the time over the continent. In the subtropical Andes (25-35°S), annual mean precipitation is similar on both sides, however, it falls from convective and stratiform precipitating clouds in the warm semester on the eastern slopes, and from stratiform precipitating clouds in the cold semester, mostly as frozen particles, on the western slopes. These different features on both slopes denote a climatic transition between the tropics and extratropics. In the extratropical Andes (south of 35°S), stratiform cloud types produces precipitation on both sides during all the year, but the annual mean precipitation and cloud frequency are enhanced on the western slopes and strongly reduced on the eastern slopes of the Andes. Cloud frequencies are higher than in the subtropics and evenly distributed as single- or multi-layers of low, middle and high clouds. Frozen particles become important in precipitating clouds over the mountains and on the lee side. These findings demonstrate the significant influence of the Andes cordillera on the climate all along southwestern South America, and constitute an excellent example of how the simple dependence of climate on latitude can be substantially altered by the topography.},

abstract = {With the objective of understanding the potential and limitations of available precipitation products for hydrological studies, this paper compares six daily and sub-daily precipitation datasets and their impacts on the water balance of the Negro River basin in the Amazon basin. The precipitation datasets contain gauge-based data [data derived from the Hybam Observatory Precipitation (HOP) dataset and provided by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC)], satellite-based data [the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) one-degree daily and TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) datasets] and model-based data [the NCEP-DOE AMIP-II re-analysis (NCEP-2) and 40-year ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) datasets]. Each dataset has a common set of meteorological forcing data which are used to run the MGB-IPH hydrological model for the period from January 1998 to August 2002.The average precipitation of all the datasets is 2542. mm for the Negro River basin, with a standard deviation of 317. mm. TMPA and NCEP-2 have the lowest (2216. mm/year) and the highest (3065. mm/year) precipitation rates, respectively. The HOP and CPC datasets agree best with observed discharge. GPCP gives the best results among the ungauged datasets, followed by ERA-40. TMPA and NCEP-2 are found to be the least accurate. TMPA can reproduce the water cycles reasonably well, but underestimates the precipitation fields and discharges over the basin, while NCEP-2 is unable to represent the rainfall quantity and cycles, and the water discharge. Results suggest that gauge-based data are still the most representative of the actual precipitation in the northern Amazon basin. However, some satellite and model-based can reproduce fairly well the water cycle at the basin scale and monthly time step. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Roughness height for heat transfer is a crucial parameter in estimation of heat transfer between the land surface and the atmosphere. Although many empirical formulations have been proposed over the past few decades, the uncertainties associated with these formulations are shown to be large, especially over sparse canopies. In this contribution, a simple physically based model is derived for the estimation of the roughness height for heat transfer. This model is derived from a complex physical model based on the "localized near-field" Lagrangian theory. This model (called Massman's model) and another recently proposed model derived by fitting simulation results of a simple multisource bulk transfer model (termed Bl{\"{u}}mel's model) are evaluated using three experimental datasets. The results of the model performances are judged by using the derived roughness values to compute sensible heat fluxes with the bulk transfer formulation and comparing these computed fluxes to the observed sensible heat fluxes. It is concluded, on the basis of comparison of calculated versus observed sensible heat fluxes, that both the current model and Bl{\"{u}}mel's model provide reliable estimates of the roughness heights for heat transfer. The current model is further shown to be able to explain the diurnal variation in the roughness height for heat transfer. On the basis of a sensitivity analysis, it is suggested that, although demanding, most of the information needed for both models is amendable by satellite remote sensing such that their global incorporation into large-scale atmospheric models for both numerical weather prediction and climate research merits further investigation.},

abstract = {Although the wet season in the tropical Amazon (10°N-20°S) at any one place and in any one year is initiated rapidly by synoptic systems, large-scale thermodynamic conditions modulate the frequency and intensity of these synoptic systems and hence control the climatology of the wet season. In this study, the satellite radiances, radiosondes, and assimilation data of the atmosphere are analyzed to show that the conditioning of the large-scale thermodynamics for the onset of the wet season is controlled by a moistening of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and a lowering of temperature at its top, hence reducing convective inhibition energy (CINE). These changes occur either in phase with or lagging by one month the enhancement of low-level moisture convergence. Integration of a slab mixed-layer model shows how a higher humidity can reduce the drying effect of the entrainment and increase the humidity of the daytime PBL. Hence, the increase of low-level moisture convergence may provide enough moisture to initiate the wet seasons. In the southern part of the basin (5°S-20°S), the land surface warming from austral winter to spring reduces the strong stability of the dry season and increases the frequency of unstable profiles for deep convection (fCUS), but convection remains infrequent until, in addition, the PBL is moistened and the inversion decays to lower CINE in October. The latter occur one month after the moisture becomes convergent. The seasonal changes in land surface temperatures are stronger than those over the adjacent oceans and hence have more influence on the gradient between land and ocean, and so on the changes in the large-scale circulation. In the equatorial western Amazon, a warmer land surface provides high fCUS all year round, but the seasonal changes of convection are more controlled by CINE. In the eastern basin, a lower fCUS in spring suppresses the expected wet season. Hence, convection is most frequent during austral fall, but also occurs in austral spring in the western Amazon. Higher fCUS and lower CINE are largely contributed to by the increases in humidity and weakening of the inversion. In contrast to the southern part of the basin, changes in local land surface temperature are small so that changes of the surface temperature in the adjacent oceans and southern Amazon largely control the changes in temperature gradient between land and ocean, and hence the seasonal onset of equatorial convection.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017. The Authors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the data sources and estimation methods of 30 currently available global precipitation data sets, including gauge-based, satellite-related, and reanalysis data sets. We analyzed the discrepancies between the data sets from daily to annual timescales and found large differences in both the magnitude and the variability of precipitation estimates. The magnitude of annual precipitation estimates over global land deviated by as much as 300 mm/yr among the products. Reanalysis data sets had a larger degree of variability than the other types of data sets. The degree of variability in precipitation estimates also varied by region. Large differences in annual and seasonal estimates were found in tropical oceans, complex mountain areas, northern Africa, and some high-latitude regions. Overall, the variability associated with extreme precipitation estimates was slightly greater at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes. The reliability of precipitation data sets is mainly limited by the number and spatial coverage of surface stations, the satellite algorithms, and the data assimilation models. The inconsistencies described limit the capability of the products for climate monitoring, attribution, and model validation.},

abstract = {Land surface waters play a primary role in the global water cycle and climate. As a consequence, there is a widespread demand for accurate and long-term quantitative observations of their distribution over the whole globe. This study presents the first global data set that quantifies the monthly distribution of surface water extent at ∼25 km sampling intervals over 12 years (1993-2004). These estimates, generated from complementary multiple-satellite observations, including passive (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) and active (ERS scatterometer) microwaves along with visible and near-infrared imagery (advanced very high-resolution radiometer; AVHRR), were first developed over 1993-2000. The ERS encountered technical problems in 2001 and the processing scheme had to be adapted to extend the time series. Here we investigate and discuss the adjustments of the methodology, compare the various options, and show that the data set can be extended with good confidence beyond 2000, using ERS and AVHRR mean monthly climatologies. In addition to a large seasonal and interannual variability, the new results show a slight overall decrease in global inundated area between 1993 and 2004, representing an ∼5.7% reduction of the mean annual maximum in 12 years. The decrease is mainly observed in the tropics during the 1990s. Over inland water bodies and large river basins, we assess the variability of the surface water extent against related variables such as in situ river discharges, altimeter-derived and in situ river/floodplain water level heights, and precipitation estimates. This new 12 year data set of global surface water extent represents an unprecedented source of information for future hydrological or methane modeling.

abstract = {Accurate and timely surface precipitation measurements are crucial for water resources management, agriculture, weather prediction, climate research, as well as ground validation of satellite-based precipitation estimates. However, the majority of the land surface of the earth lacks such data, and in many parts of the world the density of surface precipitation gauging networks is even rapidly declining. This development can potentially be counteracted by using received signal level data from the enormous number of microwave links used worldwide in commercial cellular communication networks. Along such links, radio signals propagate from a transmitting antenna at one base station to a receiving antenna at another base station. Rain-induced attenuation and, subsequently, path-averaged rainfall intensity can be retrieved from the signal's attenuation between transmitter and receiver. Here, we show how one such a network can be used to retrieve the space-time dynamics of rainfall for an entire country (The Netherlands, ∼35,500 km2), based on an unprecedented number of links (∼2,400) and a rainfall retrieval algorithm that can be applied in real time. This demonstrates the potential of such networks for real-time rainfall monitoring, in particular in those parts of the world where networks of dedicated ground-based rainfall sensors are often virtually absent.},

abstract = {Closing the terrestrial water budget is necessary to provide consistent estimates of budget components for understanding water resources and changes over time. Given the lack of in situ observations of budget components at anything but local scale, merging information from multiple data sources (e.g., in situ observation, satellite remote sensing, land surface model, and reanalysis) through data assimilation techniques that optimize the estimation of fluxes is a promising approach. Conditioned on the current limited data availability, a systematic method is developed to optimally combine multiple available data sources for precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and the total water storage change (TWSC) at 0.5 degrees spatial resolution globally and to obtain water budget closure (i.e., to enforce P - ET - R - TWSC = 0) through a constrained Kalman filter (CKF) data assimilation technique under the assumption that the deviation from the ensemble mean of all data sources for the same budget variable is used as a proxy of the uncertainty in individual water budget variables. The resulting long-term (1984-2010), monthly 0.5 degrees resolution global terrestrial water cycle Climate Data Record (CDR) data set is developed under the auspices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) program. This data set serves to bridge the gap between sparsely gauged regions and the regions with sufficient in situ observations in investigating the temporal and spatial variability in the terrestrial hydrology at multiple scales. The CDR created in this study is validated against in situ measurements like river discharge from the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and ET from FLUXNET. The data set is shown to be reliable and can serve the scientific community in understanding historical climate variability in water cycle fluxes and stores, benchmarking the current climate, and validating models.},

abstract = {The location of eight rainfall stations in the Zongo valley (Eastern Cordillera-Bolivia) between 1195 and 4750 meters above sea level (masl) gives a unique opportunity to study the time-space rainfall variability between two regions, i.e. the Altiplano and the Amazonian lowlands of Bolivia, that are differently related to El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the Pacific. In the central part of the lowlands, a La Ni{\~{n}}a/dry signal is observed during the peak of the rainy season (February) and around wintertime (May and September). Going toward the Andes and on the foothills up to 1500 masl, no ENSO signal has been found. On the median slopes of the Zongo valley, between 1800 and 3500 m, a strong Ni{\~{n}}o/dry signal is depicted on an annual timescale and during summer. In February, a Ni{\~{n}}a/wet signal is also significant. Going westward through the high Andes and the eastern Altiplano, this signal weakens. On the western edge of the Altiplano, an El Ni{\~{n}}o/dry and La Ni{\~{n}}a/wet signals are clearly identified. In the central lowlands and on the western Altiplano, ENSO indexes account for nearly 25% of rainfall variability, and for as much as 50% along the median slopes of the eastern Cordillera, in the Zongo valley. This finding deserves further study as previous researches have shown that in the Andes the best relationship between rainfall and equatorial Pacific sea-surface temperature (SST) is in the westem Altiplano, far from the Amazonian source of moisture.

abstract = {Spatial water resource monitoring systems (SWRMS) can provide valuable information in support of water management, but current operational systems are few and provide only a subset of the information required. Necessary innovations include the explicit description of water redistribution and water use from river and groundwater systems, achieving greater spatial detail (particularly in key features such as irrigated areas and wetlands), and improving accuracy as assessed against hydrometric observations, as well as assimilating those observations. The Australian water resources assessment (AWRA) system aims to achieve this by coupling landscape models with models describing surface water and groundwater dynamics and water use. A review of operational and research applications demonstrates that satellite observations can improve accuracy and spatial detail in hydrological model estimation. All operational systems use dynamic forcing, land cover classifications and a priori parameterisation of vegetation dynamics that are partially or wholly derived from remote sensing. Satellite observations are used to varying degrees in model evaluation and data assimilation. The utility of satellite observations through data assimilation can vary as a function of dominant hydrological processes. Opportunities for improvement are identified, including the development of more accurate and higher spatial and temporal resolution precipitation products, and the use of a greater range of remote sensing products in a priori model parameter estimation, model evaluation and data assimilation. Operational challenges include the continuity of research satellite missions and data services, and the need to find computationally-efficient data assimilation techniques. The successful use of observations critically depends on the availability of detailed information on observational error and understanding of the relationship between remotely-sensed and model variables, as affected by conceptual discrepancies and spatial and temporal scaling.},

abstract = {The Amazon basin is experiencing rapid forest loss and fragmentation. Fragmented forests are more prone than intact forests to periodic damage from El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) droughts, which cause elevated tree mortality, increased litterfall, shifts in plant phenology, and other ecological changes, especially near forest edges. Moreover, positive feedbacks among forest loss, fragmentation, fire, and regional climate change appear increasingly likely. Deforestation reduces plant evapotranspiration, which in turn constrains regional rainfall, increasing the vulnerability of forests to fire. Forest fragments are especially vulnerable because they have dry, fire-prone edges, are logged frequently, and often are adjoined by cattle pastures, which are burned regularly. The net result is that there may be a critical "deforestation threshold" above which Amazonian rainforests can no longer be sustained, particularly in relatively seasonal areas of the basin. Global warming could exacerbate this problem if it promotes drier climates or stronger ENSO droughts. Synergisms among many simultaneous environmental changes are posing unprecedented threats to Amazonian forests.},

The initial satellite precipitation data comparisons show that the reanalyzed 3B42V6, with a bias of -4.54%, matched best with the rain gauge observations, while the two near real-time satellite datasets (3B42RT and CMORPH) largely underestimated precipitation by 42.72% and 40.81% respectively. With the model parameters first benchmarked by the rain gauge data, the behavior of the streamflow simulation from the 3B42V6 was also the most optimal amongst the three products, while the two near real-time satellite datasets produced deteriorated biases and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSCEs). Still, when the model parameters were recalibrated by each individual satellite data, the performance of the streamflow simulations from the two near real-time satellite products were significantly improved, thus demonstrating the need for specific calibrations of the hydrological models for the near real-time satellite inputs. Moreover, when optimally merged with respect to the streamflows forced by the two near real-time satellite precipitation products and all the three satellite precipitation products using the Bayesian model averaging method, the resulted streamflow series further improved and became more robust. In summary, the three current state-of-the-art satellite precipitation products have demonstrated potential in hydrological research and applications. The benchmarking, recalibration, and optimal merging schemes for streamflow simulation at a basin scale described in the present work will hopefully be a reference for future utilizations of satellite precipitation products in global and regional hydrological applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Nine satellite rainfall estimations (SREs) were evaluated for the first time over the South American Andean plateau watershed by comparison with rain gauge data acquired between 2005 and 2007. The comparisons were carried out at the annual, monthly and daily time steps. All SREs reproduce the salient pattern of the annual rain field, with a marked north–south gradient and a lighter east–west gradient. However, the intensity of the gradient differs among SREs: it is well marked in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42 (TMPA-3B42), Precipitation Estimation from remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) products, and it is smoothed out in the Climate prediction center MORPHing (CMORPH) products. Another interesting difference among products is the contrast in rainfall amounts between the water surfaces (Lake Titicaca) and the surrounding land. Some products (TMPA-3B42, PERSIANN and GSMaP) show a contradictory rainfall deficit over Lake Titicaca, which may be due to the emissivity contrast between the lake and the surrounding lands and warm rain cloud processes. An analysis differentiating coastal Lake Titicaca from inland pixels confirmed this trend. The raw or Real Time (RT) products have strong biases over the study region. These biases are strongly positive for PERSIANN (above 90%), moderately positive for TMPA-3B42 (28%), strongly negative for CMORPH (− 42%) and moderately negative for GSMaP (− 18%). The biases are associated with a deformation of the rain rate frequency distribution: GSMaP underestimates the proportion of rainfall events for all rain rates; CMORPH overestimates the proportion of rain rates below 2 mm day − 1 ; and the other products tend to overestimate the proportion of moderate to high rain rates. These biases are greatly reduced by the gauge adjustment in the TMPA-3B42, PERSIANN and CMORPH products, whereas a negative bias becomes positive for GSMaP. TMPA-3B42 Adjusted (Adj) version 7 demonstrates the best overall agreement with gauges in terms of correlation, rain rate distribution and bias. However, PERSIANN-Adj's bias in the southern part of the domain is very low.},

abstract = {Tropical forests have an important regulating influence on local and regional climate, through modulating the exchange of moisture and energy between the land and the atmosphere. Deforestation disrupts this exchange, though the climatic consequences of progressive, patch-scale deforestation of formerly intact forested landscapes have not previously been assessed. Remote sensing datasets of land surface and atmospheric variables were used to compare the climate responses of Amazon evergreen broadleaf forests that lost their intact status between 2000 and 2013. Clear gradients in environmental change with increasing disturbance were observed. Leaf area index (LAI) showed progressively stronger reductions as forest loss increased, with evapotranspiration (ET) showing a comparative decline. These changes in LAI and ET were related to changes in temperature (T), with increased warming as deforestation increased. Severe deforestation of intact Amazon forest, defined as areas where canopy cover was reduced below 70 %, was shown to have increased daytime land surface T by 0.44 °C over the study period. Differences between intact and disturbed forests were most pronounced during the dry season, with severely deforested areas warming as much as 1.5 °C. Maintenance of canopy cover was identified as an important factor in minimising the impacts of disturbance. Overall, the results highlight the climate benefits provided by intact tropical forests, providing further evidence that protecting intact forests is of utmost importance.},

abstract = {The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), features several major advances from the original MERRA reanalysis, including the use, outside of high latitudes, of observations-based precipitation data products to correct the precipitation falling on the land surface in the MERRA-2 system. The method for merging the observed precipitation into MERRA-2 has been refined from that of the (land-only) MERRA-Land reanalysis. This paper describes the method and evaluates the MERRA-2 land surface precipitation. Compared to monthly GPCPv2.2 observations, the corrected MERRA-2 precipitation (M2CORR) is better than the precipitation generated by the atmospheric models within the cycling MERRA-2 and MERRA systems. M2CORR is also better than MERRA-Land precipitation over Africa because in MERRA-2 a merged satellite-gauge precipitation product is used instead of the gauge-only data used for MERRA-Land. Compared to 3-hourly TRMM observations, the M2CORR diurnal cycle has better amplitude but less realistic phasing than MERRA-2 model-generated precipitation. Because correcting the precipitation within the coupled atmosphere-land modeling system allows the MERRA-2 near-surface air temperature and humidity to respond to the improved precipitation forcing, MERRA-2 provides more self-consistent surface meteorological data than were available from MERRA-Land, which is important for applications such as landonly modeling studies.Where precipitation observations of sufficient quality are available for use in the reanalysis, the corrections facilitate the seamless spinup of the land surface initial conditions across theMERRA-2 production streams. At high latitudes, however, the lack of reliable precipitation observations results in undesirable land spinup effects that impact mostly the first published year of eachMERRA-2 stream (1980, 1992, 2001, and 2011).},

abstract = {Data obtained from NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites were used to investigate the relationships between topography, large-scale circulation, and the climatology of precipitation and cloudiness in the Andes - specifically over Peru and the Altiplano Plateau - at diurnal, seasonal, and interannual time scales. The spatial variability of cloudiness was assessed through empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of GOES brightness temperatures. Results indicate that landform is the principal agent of the space-time variability of moist atmospheric processes in the Andes, with the first mode explaining up to 70% of all observed variability. These results substantiate the differences between "continental" (Andes and Himalayas) and "maritime" (Western Cordillera) orographic precipitation regimes, reflecting the degree to which upwind landmasses modulate moisture transport toward and across mountain barriers. GOES brightness temperatures show that afternoon convective activity during the rainy season is more intense on wet hydrometeorological years such as 2001, whereas the space-time structure of nighttime cloudiness at the foothills and outlets of deep interior valleys does not change during the monsoon and from one year to another independently of large-scale conditions. This suggests that daytime cloud formation and precipitation is strongly dependent on large-scale moisture transport. Interactions between mesoscale and ridge-valley circulations, which are locked to the topography, determine the space-time organization of clouds and precipitation at nighttime. This leads to strong clustering of precipitation features associated with enhanced convection at high elevations along the ridges and near the headwaters of the major river systems in the TRMM data. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This letter uses satellite remote sensing to examine patterns of cropland expansion, cropland abandonment, and changing cropping frequency in Mato Grosso, Brazil from 2001 to 2011. During this period, Mato Grosso emerged as a globally important center of agricultural production. In 2001, 3.3 million hectares of mechanized agriculture were cultivated in Mato Grosso, of which 500 000 hectares had two commercial crops per growing season (double cropping). By 2011, Mato Grosso had 5.8 million hectares of mechanized agriculture, of which 2.9 million hectares were double cropped. We found these agricultural changes to be selective with respect to land attributes - significant differences (p<0.001) existed between the land attributes of agriculture Versus non-agriculture, single cropping Versus double cropping, and expansion Versus abandonment. Many of the land attributes (elevation, slope, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, initial soy transport costs, and soil) that were associated with an increased likelihood of expansion were associated with a decreased likelihood of abandonment (p<0.001). While land similar to agriculture and double cropping in 2001 was much more likely to be developed for agriculture than all other land, new cropland shifted to hotter, drier, lower locations that were more isolated from agricultural infrastructure (p<0.001). The scarcity of high quality remaining agricultural land available for agricultural expansion in Mato Grosso could be contributing to the slowdown in agricultural expansion observed there over 2006 to 2011. Land use policy analyses should control for land scarcity constraints on agricultural expansion. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Simultaneous rainfall analyses using Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave measurements and thermal infrared measurements from Meteosat are presented for two storms over northern Italy that caused damaging floods. Upwelling brightness temperatures over precipitating clouds in the mm-cm spectrum are directly associated with precipitation microphysics throughout the cloud column down into the rain layer. In contrast, brightness temperatures in the thermal infrared window, which arise from emission near cloud top, are not directly responsive to precipitation processes. However, because of the diffraction-limited nature of passive microwave detectors, microwave radiometer ground footprints are considerably larger than those characteristic of infrared sensors, even those flown at geosynchronous altitude. Furthermore, passive microwave radiometers are flown on low-earth orbiters, which produce less than ideal sampling rates, whereas optical-infrared radiometers flown on geosynchronous orbiters produce high frequency sampling concomitant with precipitation time scales. In this study, we investigate how these two types of measuring systems could be used in a complementary fashion to improve rainfall estimation. A physically based microwave algorithm is used to estimate rainfall with SSM/I measurements, whereas a two-threshold statistical technique is used for corresponding estimates from Meteosat. Results suggest that an infrared-based analysis of rainfall derived from half-hourly geosynchronous images can be improved with a calibration-transfer approach using a microwave algorithm sensitive to vertical cloud structure.},

abstract = {This study analyzes the performance of the two soil hydrology schemes of the land surface model ORCHIDEE in estimating Amazonian hydrology and phenology for five major sub-basins (Xingu, Tapaj{\'{o}}s, Madeira, Solim{\~{o}}es and Negro), during the 29-year period 1980–2008. A simple 2-layer scheme with a bucket topped by an evaporative layer is compared to an 11-layer diffusion scheme. The soil schemes are coupled with a river routing module and a process model of plant physiology, phenology and carbon dynamics. The simulated water budget and vegetation functioning components are compared with several data sets at sub-basin scale. The use of the 11-layer soil diffusion scheme does not significantly change the Amazonian water budget simulation when compared to the 2- layer soil scheme (+3.1 and −3.0% in evapotranspiration and river discharge, respectively). However, the higher water-holding capacity of the soil and the physically based representation of runoff and drainage in the 11-layer soil diffusion scheme result in more dynamic soil water storage variation and improved simulation of the total terrestrial water storage when compared to GRACE satellite estimates. The greater soil water storage within the 11-layer scheme also results in increased dry-season evapotranspiration (+0.5mmd−1, +17 %) and improves river discharge simulation in the southeastern sub-basins such as the Xingu. Evapotranspiration over this sub-basin is sustained during the whole dry season with the 11-layer soil diffusion scheme, whereas the 2-layer scheme limits it after only 2 dry months. Lower plant drought stress simulated by the 11-layer soil diffusion scheme leads to better simulation of the seasonal cycle of photosynthesis (GPP) when compared to a GPP data-driven model based on eddy covariance and satellite greenness measurements. A dry-season length between 4 and 7 months over the entire Amazon Basin is found to be critical in distinguishing differences in hydrological feedbacks between the soil and the vegetation cover simulated by the two soil schemes. On average, the multilayer soil diffusion scheme provides little improvement in simulated hydrology over the wet tropical Amazonian sub-basins, but a more significant improvement is found over the drier sub-basins. The use of a multilayer soil diffusion scheme might become critical for assessments of future hydrological changes, especially in southern regions of the Amazon Basin where longer dry seasons and more severe droughts are expected in the next century.},

abstract = {In the Amazon basin, the recently released SRTM Global 1 arc-second (SRTMGL1) remains the best topographic information for hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling purposes. However, its accuracy is hindered by errors, partly due to vegetation, leading to erroneous simulations. Previous efforts to remove the vegetation signal either did not account for its spatial variability or relied on a single assumed percentage of penetration of the SRTM signal. Here, we propose a systematic approach over an Amazonian floodplain to remove the vegetation signal, addressing its heterogeneity by combining estimates of vegetation height and a land cover map. We improve this approach by interpolating the first results with drainage network, field and altimetry data to obtain a hydrological conditioned DEM. The averaged interferometric and vegetation biases over the forest zone were found to b{\'{e}}2.0 m and 7.4 m, respectively. Comparing the original and corrected DEM, vertical validation against Ground Control Points shows a RMSE reduction of 64%. Flood extent accuracy, controlled against Landsat and JERS-1 images, stresses improvements in low and high water periods (+24% and +18%, respectively). This study also highlights that a ground truth drainage network, as a unique input during the interpolation, achieves reasonable results in terms of flood extent and hydrological characteristics.},

Climate change has also a direct hydrological impact, and increasing efforts have focused on understanding the hydrological dynamics at continental and subregional scales, such as the Western Amazon. New projections from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 ensemble indicate consistent climatic warming and increasing seasonality of precipitation in the Peruvian Amazon basin. Here we use a distributed land surface model to quantify the potential impact of this change in the climate on the hydrological regime of the upper Amazon river. Using extreme value analysis, historical and future projections of the annual minimum, mean, and maximum river flows are produced for a range of return periods between 1 and 100 yr. We show that the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios of climate change project an increased severity of the wet season flood pulse (7.5% and 12% increases respectively for the 100 yr return floods). These findings agree with previously projected increases in high extremes under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios climate projections, and are important to highlight due to the potential consequences on reproductive processes of in-stream species, swamp forest ecology, and socio-economy in the floodplain, amidst a growing literature that more strongly emphasises future droughts and their impact on the viability of the rainforest system over greater Amazonia.},

abstract = {Large-scale hydrological models are nowadays mostly calibrated using observed discharge. As a result, a large part of the hydrological system, in particular the unsaturated zone, remains uncalibrated. Soil moisture observations from satellites have the potential to fill this gap. Here we evaluate the added value of remotely sensed soil moisture in calibration of large-scale hydrological models by addressing two research questions: (1) Which parameters of hydrological models can be identified by calibration with remotely sensed soil moisture? (2) Does calibration with remotely sensed soil moisture lead to an improved calibration of hydrological models compared to calibration based only on discharge observations, such that this leads to improved simulations of soil moisture content and discharge? A dual state and parameter Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to calibrate the hydrological model LISFLOOD for the Upper Danube. Calibration is done using discharge and remotely sensed soil moisture acquired by AMSR-E, SMOS, and ASCAT. Calibration with discharge data improves the estimation of groundwater and routing parameters. Calibration with only remotely sensed soil moisture results in an accurate identification of parameters related to land-surface processes. For the Upper Danube upstream area up to 40,000 km2, calibration on both discharge and soil moisture results in a reduction by 10–30% in the RMSE for discharge simulations, compared to calibration on discharge alone. The conclusion is that remotely sensed soil moisture holds potential for calibration of hydrological models, leading to a better simulation of soil moisture content throughout the catchment and a better simulation of discharge in upstream areas.},

abstract = {[1] Modeling the routing of flood waters across large floodplains is challenging because flows respond to dynamic hydraulic controls from complex geomorphology, vegetation, and multiple water sources. In this study, we analyzed the topographic and hydrologic controls of inundation dynamics of a large floodplain unit (2440 km 2) along the lower Amazon River. We combined land topography derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) with underwater topography derived from an extensive echo-sounding survey to generate a seamless digital elevation model (DEM). Floodplain inundation was simulated using LISFLOOD-FP, which combines one-dimensional river routing with two-dimensional overland flow, and a local hydrological model. For the first time, accurate simulation of filling and drainage of an Amazon floodplain was achieved with quantification of changes in water elevation, flooding extent, and river-floodplain exchange. We examined the role of diffuse overbank versus channelized flows on river-floodplain exchange. Diffuse overbank flows represent 93% of total river to floodplain discharge and 54% of floodplain to river discharge. Floodplain discharge during high-water was four times higher than field observation values when the SRTM v.4 DEM with no correction was used for simulation because of a 24.4 m elevation bias originating from residual motion errors of the SRTM interferometric baseline.

abstract = {An innovative remote sensing approach that combines land-use change and water quality information is proposed in order to investigate if Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) area extension is associated with water siltation in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River Basin (Brazil), containing the largest small-scale gold mining district in the world. Taking advantage of a 40-year period of the multi-satellite imagery archive, the objective of this paper is to build a normalized time-series in order to evaluate the influence of temporal mining expansion on the water siltation data (TSS, Total Suspended Solids concentration) derived from previous research. The methodological approach was set to deliver a full characterization of the ASGM expansion from its initial stages in the early 1970s to the present. First, based on IRS/LISSIII images acquired in 2012, the historical Landsat image database (1973–2001) was corrected for radiometric and atmospheric effects using dark vegetation as reference to create a normalized time-series. Next, a complete update of the mining areas distribution in 2012 derived from the TerraClass Project (an official land-use classification for the Brazilian Amazon) was conducted having IRS/LISSIII as the base map with the support of auxiliary data and vector editing. Once the ASGM in 2012 was quantified (261.7 km2) and validated with photos, a reverse classification of ASGM in 2001 (171.7 km2), 1993 (166.3 km2), 1984 (47.5 km2), and 1973 (15.4 km2) with the use of Landsat archives was applied. This procedure relies on the assumption that ASGM changes in the land cover are severe and remain detectable from satellite sensors for decades. The mining expansion area over time was then combined with the (TSS) data retrieved from the same atmospherically corrected satellite imagery based on the literature. In terms of gold mining expansion and water siltation effects, four main periods of ASGM activities were identified in the study area: (i) 1958–1977, first occurrence of mining activities and low water impacts; (ii) 1978–1993, introduction of low-budget mechanization associated with very high gold prices resulting in large mining area expansion and high water siltation levels; (iii) 1994–2003, general recession of ASGM activities and exhaustion of easy-access gold deposits, resulting in decreased TSS; (iv) 2004 to present, intensification of ASGM encouraged by high gold prices, resulting in an increase of TSS.},

The distribution of precipitation was measured using the Gini index (which describes how uniformly precipitation is distributed throughout a year) and the annual number of wet days. The Mann-Kendall test and a regression analysis were used to assess the direction and rate of change to both indices. Over the period of 1976-2000, East Asia, Central America, and Brazil exhibited a decrease in the number of both wet and light precipitation days, and eastern Europe exhibited a decrease in the number of both wet and moderate precipitation days. In contrast, the U.S., southern South America, western Europe, and Australia exhibited an increase in the number of both wet and light precipitation days.

@article{Anderson1997,
abstract = {We present an operational two-source (soil + vegetation) model for evaluating the surface energy balance given measurements of the rate of change in radio-metric surface temperature (T(RAD)) during the morning hours. This model consists of a two-source surface component describing the relation between T(RAD) and sensible heat flux, coupled with a time-integrated component connecting surface heating with planetary boundary layer development. By typing together the time-dependent behavior of surface temperature and the temperature in the boundary layer with the flux of sensible heat from the surface to the atmosphere, the need for ancillary measurements of near-surface air temperature is eliminated. This is a significant benefit when T(BAD) is acquired remotely. Air temperature can be strongly coupled to local biophysical surface conditions and, if the surface air and brightness temperature measurements used by a model are not collocated, energy flux estimates can be significantly corrupted. Furthermore, because this model uses only temporal changes in radiometric temperatures rather than absolute temperatures, time-independent biases in T(RAD) resulting from effects or other sources, do not affect the estimated fluxes; only time-varying component of corrections need be computed. The algorithm also decomposes the surface radiometric temperature into its soil and vegetation contributions, thus the angular dependence of T(RAD) can be predicted from an observation of T(RAD) at a single view angle. This capability is critical to an accurate interpretation of off-nadir measurements from polar orbiting and geosynchronous satellites, the performance of this model has been evaluated in comparison with data collected during two large-scale field experiments: the first International Satellite LAnd Surface Climatology Project field experiment, conducted in and around the Konza Prairie in Kansas, and the Monsoon '90 experiment, conducted in the semiarid rangelands of the Walnut Gulch Watershed in southern Arizona. Both comparisons yielded uncertainties comparable to those achieved by models that do require air temperature as an input and to measurement errors typical of standard micrometeorological methods for flux estimation. A strategy for applying the two-source time-integrated model on a regional or continental scale is briefly outlined.},

abstract = {The measurement of global precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, is critical to a wide range of users and applications. Rain gauges are indispensable in the measurement of precipitation, remaining the de facto standard for precipitation information across Earth's surface for hydrometeorological purposes. However, their distribution across the globe is limited: over land their distribution and density is variable, while over oceans very few gauges exist and where measurements are made, they may not adequately reflect the rainfall amounts of the broader area. Critically, the number of gauges available, or appropriate for a particular study, varies greatly across the Earth owing to temporal sampling resolutions, periods of operation, data latency, and data access. Numbers of gauges range from a few thousand available in near–real time to about 100,000 for all “official” gauges, and to possibly hundreds of thousands if all possible gauges are included. Gauges routinely used in the generation of global precipitation products cover an equivalent area of between about 250 and 3,000 m2. For comparison, the center circle of a soccer pitch or tennis court is about 260 m2. Although each gauge should represent more than just the gauge orifice, autocorrelation distances of precipitation vary greatly with regime and the integration period. Assuming each Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC)–available gauge is independent and represents a surrounding area of 5-km radius, this represents only about 1% of Earth's surface. The situation is further confounded for snowfall, which has a greater measurement uncertainty.},

abstract = {Different satellite rainfall products are used in different applications over different parts of the world. These products are particularly important over many parts of Africa, where they are used to augment the very sparse rain-gauge network. However, the quality of the different satellite products varies from one product to another and from one climatic region to another. The climate over eastern Africa varies from wet coastal and mountainous regions to dry arid regions. Significant variations could be observed within short distances. The different climates will pose different challenges to satellite rainfall retrieval over this region. This study explores the effect of mountainous and arid climates on four different satellite rainfall-estimation (RFE) algorithms. The mountainous climate is located over the Ethiopian highlands, while the arid region covers parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. One infrared-only product, African rainfall climatology (ARC), one passive-microwave-only product (the Climate Prediction Center morphing technique, CMORPH) and two products (the RFE algorithm and the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM-3B42)), which combine both infrared and passive-microwave estimates, are used for this investigation. All the products exhibit moderate underestimation of rainfall over the highlands of Ethiopia, while the overestimation over the dry region is found to be very high. The underestimation over the mountainous region is ascribed to the warm orographic rain process, while the overestimation over the dry region may be because of sub-cloud evaporation. Local calibration of satellite algorithms and merging of satellite estimates with all locally available rain-gauge observations are some of the approaches that could be employed to alleviate these problems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Spatial water resource monitoring systems (SWRMS) can provide valuable information in support of water management, but current operational systems are few and provide only a subset of the information required. Necessary innovations include the explicit description of water redistribution and water use from river and groundwater systems, achieving greater spatial detail (particularly in key features such as irrigated areas and wetlands), and improving accuracy as assessed against hydrometric observations, as well as assimilating those observations. The Australian water resources assessment (AWRA) system aims to achieve this by coupling landscape models with models describing surface water and groundwater dynamics and water use. A review of operational and research applications demonstrates that satellite observations can improve accuracy and spatial detail in hydrological model estimation. All operational systems use dynamic forcing, land cover classifications and a priori parameterisation of vegetation dynamics that are partially or wholly derived from remote sensing. Satellite observations are used to varying degrees in model evaluation and data assimilation. The utility of satellite observations through data assimilation can vary as a function of dominant hydrological processes. Opportunities for improvement are identified, including the development of more accurate and higher spatial and temporal resolution precipitation products, and the use of a greater range of remote sensing products in a priori model parameter estimation, model evaluation and data assimilation. Operational challenges include the continuity of research satellite missions and data services, and the need to find computationally-efficient data assimilation techniques. The successful use of observations critically depends on the availability of detailed information on observational error and understanding of the relationship between remotely-sensed and model variables, as affected by conceptual discrepancies and spatial and temporal scaling.},

abstract = {PERSIANN, an automated system for Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks, has been developed for the estimation of rainfall from geosynchronous satellite longwave infared imagery (GOES-IR) at a resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° every half-hour. The accuracy of the rainfall product is improved by adaptively adjusting the network parameters using the instantaneous rain-rate estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) microwave imager (TMI product 2A12), and the random errors are further reduced by accumulation to a resolution of 1° × 1° daily. The authors' current GOES-IR - TRMM TMI based product, named PERSIANN-GT, was evaluated over the region 30°S-30°N, 90°E-30°W, which includes the tropical Pacific Ocean and parts of Asia, Australia, and the Americas. The resulting rain-rate estimates agree well with the National Climatic Data Center radar-gauge composite data over Florida and Texas (correlation coefficient p > 0.7). The product also compares well (p ̃ 0.77-0.90) with the monthly World Meteorological Organization gauge measurements for 5° × 5° grid locations having high gauge densities. The PERSIANN-GT product was evaluated further by comparing it with current TRMM products (3A11, 3B31, 3B42, 3B43) over the entire study region. The estimates compare well with the TRMM 3B43 1° × 1° monthly product, but the PERSIANN-GT products indicate higher rainfall over the western Pacific Ocean when compared to the adjusted geosynchronous precipitation index-based TRMM 3B42 product.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to improve the understanding of the spatial dynamics of evapotranspiration (ET) with a focus on the influence of the current level of Amazonian deforestation through comparative statistics of different land cover. The study area comprised the state of Rond{\^{o}}nia, Brazil, which was subdivided into homogeneous regions regarding ET using cluster analysis. In addition, we analyzed the use of a logistic regression model to create deforestation maps in the Amazon based on ET fields. We used orbital data on ET and land cover type from the MOD16 product and the Amazon Forest Satellite Monitoring Project (PRODES), respectively, considering the period from 2000 to 2014. The cluster analysis results showed that for the study area, three homogeneous sub-regions were sufficient to represent the ET variability, mainly considering the intensity and seasonal pattern of this process. Regarding the impacts after changing from forest to deforested area, the analyses indicated that the ET of deforested areas decreased by an average of 28% in the dry period and increased by 4% in the rainy season. The effects observed in the rainy season were not significant at 5% significance according to the Student t-test, unlike the dry period, which presented statistical significance (p-value <0.05). In general, the results indicated that MOD16 data can provide a satisfactory representation of the change in ET in large areas of the Brazilian Amazon. Logistic regression analysis showed that the spatial pattern of deforestation can be identified by biophysical factors such as ET with 87% accuracy, despite the spatial/temporal variability present in the region. These results support this approach as an effective tool for spatial identification of Amazonian deforestation.},

abstract = {Rainfall variability in the Amazon basin is studied in relation to sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) in the equatorial Pacific and the northern and southern tropical Atlantic during the 1977-99 period, using the HiBAm original rainfall data set and complementary cluster and composite analyses. The northeastern part of the basin, north of 5°S and east of 60°W, is significantly related with tropical SSTs: a rainier wet season is observed when the equatorial Pacific and the northern (southern) tropical Atlantic are anomalously cold (warm). A shorter and drier wet season is observed during El Ni{\~{n}}o events and negative rainfall anomalies are also significantly associated with a warm northern Atlantic in the austral autumn and a cold southern Atlantic in the spring. The northeastern Amazon rainfall anomalies are closely related with El Ni{\~{n}}o-southern oscillation during the whole year, whereas the relationships with the tropical Atlantic SST anomalies are mainly observed during the autumn. A time-space continuity is observed between El Ni{\~{n}}o-related rainfall anomalies in the northeastern Amazon, those in the northern Amazon and south-eastern Amazon, and those in northern South America and in the Nordeste of Brazil. A reinforcement of certain rainfall anomalies is observed when specific oceanic events combine. For instance, when El Ni{\~{n}}o and cold SSTs in the southern Atlantic are associated, very strong negative anomalies are observed in the whole northern Amazon basin. Nonetheless, the comparison of the cluster and the composite analyses results shows that the rainfall anomalies in the northeastern Amazon are not always associated with tropical SST anomalies. In the southern and western Amazon, significant tropical SST-related rainfall anomalies are very few and spatially variable. The precipitation origins differ from those of the northeastern Amazon: land temperature variability, extratropical perturbations and moisture advection are important rainfall factors, as well as SSTs. This could partially explain why: (a) the above-mentioned signals weaken or disappear, with the exception of the relative dryness that is observed at the peak of an El Ni{\~{n}}o event and during the dry season when northern Atlantic SSTs are warmer than usual; (b) rainfall anomalies tend to resemble those of southeastern South America, noticeably at the beginning and the end of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events; (c) some strong excesses of rain are not associated with any SST anomalies and merit further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.},

In this work, we used three decades (1983-2014) of PERSIANN-CDR daily rainfall data to characterize precipitation patterns in the southern part of the Amazon basin, which has been drastically impacted in recent decades by anthropogenic activities that exacerbate the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall regimes. We computed metrics for the rainy season (onset date, demise date and duration) on a pixel-to-pixel basis for each year in the time series. We identified significant trends toward a shortening of the rainy season in the southern Amazon, mainly linked to earlier demise dates. This work thus contributes to monitoring possible signs of climate change in the region and to assessing uncertainties in rainfall trends and their potential impacts on human activities and natural ecosystems.},

One key component of IMERG is the morphing algorithm, which uses motion vectors to perform quasi-Lagrangian interpolation to fill in gaps in the passive microwave precipitation field using motion vectors. Up to IMERG V05, the motion vectors were derived from the large-scale motions of infrared observations of cloud tops. This study details the changes introduced in IMERG V06 to derive motion vectors from large-scale motions of selected atmospheric variables in numerical models, which allow IMERG estimates to be extended from the 608N–608S latitude band to the entire globe. Evaluation against both instantaneous passive microwave retrievals and ground measurements demonstrates the general improvement in the precipitation field of the new approach. Most of the model variables tested exhibited similar performance, but total precipitable water vapor was chosen as the source of the motion vectors for IMERG V06 due to its competitive performance and global completeness. Continuing assessments will provide further insights into possible refinements of this revised morphing scheme in future versions of IMERG.},

abstract = {Deforestation reduced forest cover in Brazil's Xingu River Basin (XB; area: 510,000km2) from 90% of the basin in the 1970s to 75% in the 2000s. Such large-scale land cover changes can substantially alter regional water budgets, but their influence can be difficult to isolate from that of natural climate variability. In this study, we estimate changes to the XB water balance from the 1970s to the 2000s due to climate variations and deforestation, using a combination of long-term observations of rainfall and discharge; satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration (MODIS) and surface water storage (GRACE); and numerical modeling estimates (IBIS) of water budget components (evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and discharge). Model simulations over this period suggest that climate variations alone accounted for a -82mm decrease (mean per unit area) in annual discharge (-14%, from 8190m3s-1 to 7806m3s-1), due to a -2% decrease in precipitation and +3% increase in evapotranspiration. Deforestation alone caused a +34mm increase in annual discharge (+6%), as a result of a -3% decrease in evapotranspiration and +1% increase in soil moisture across the XB. Climate variability and land cover change thus had opposite effects on the XB water balance, with climate effects masking deforestation-induced changes to the water budget. Protected areas, which cover 55% of the basin, have helped to mitigate the effects of past deforestation on water recycling in the Xingu. However, our results suggest that continued deforestation outside protected areas could trigger changes of sufficient magnitude to offset climate variability.},

abstract = {Water siltation caused by artisanal gold mining has impacted the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River Basin in Brazil for the past 40. years, however spatial-temporal information about changes in water quality and consequences to the aquatic environment is lacking. To address this, the Landsat satellite family sensors were used to retrieve total suspended solids (TSS) of the water of the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River from 1973 to 2013. An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed.},

abstract = {In this work we document and analyze the hydrological annual cycles characterized by a rapid transition between low and high flows in the Amazonas River (Peruvian Amazon) and we show how these events, which may impact vulnerable riverside residents, are related to regional climate variability. Our analysis is based on comprehensive discharge, rainfall and average suspended sediment data sets. Particular attention is paid to the 2010–11 hydrological year, when an unprecedented abrupt transition from the extreme September 2010 drought (8300 m 3 s −1 ) to one of the four highest discharges in April 2011 (49 500 m 3 s −1 ) was recorded at Tamshiyacu (Amazonas River). This unusual transition is also observed in average suspended sediments. Years with a rapid increase in discharge are characterized by negative sea surface temperature anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific during austral summer, corresponding to a La Ni{\~{n}}a-like mode. It originates a geopotential height wave train over the subtropical South Pacific and southeastern South America, with a negative anomaly along the southern Amazon and the southeastern South Atlantic convergence zone region. As a consequence, the monsoon flux is retained over the Amazon and a strong convergence of humidity occurs in the Peruvian Amazon basin, favoring high rainfall and discharge. These features are also reported during the 2010–11 austral summer, when an intense La Ni{\~{n}}a event characterized the equatorial Pacific.},

abstract = {Amazonian rainfall plays a critical role in the global climate system and the hydrological cycle. It is thus important to quantify changes in the Amazonian rainfall and clarify its mechanism. Previous studies indicate that the interannual variability of Amazonian precipitation could be largely attributed to variabilities in the South American monsoon system and the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation. However, the trend of the wet season tropical Amazonian precipitation during recent decades is not very well investigated. In this study, by combining both satellite and in situ observations, it is revealed that tropical Amazonian precipitation has significantly increased by ∼180 to 600 mm (in different datasets) in the wet season during the satellite era from 1979 to 2015. We then use a state-of-the-art atmospheric model to simulate the impact of the tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on the precipitation changes. Results show that the multidecadal warming of the tropical Atlantic has contributed more than half of this precipitation change over the past three decades, while the east Pacific cooling plays a secondary role. We finally combine the simulation results and the reanalysis data to investigate the mechanisms of this process, i.e. the SST variability dramatically increases the convergence of the moisture transport over the Amazon region. The precipitation changes over the Amazon region largely impact on the local hydrological cycle and the ecosystem, and have important impacts on the global climate system by mediating the teleconnection between the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. Our results show that the long-term change in the wet season Amazonian precipitation is important and deserves further investigation and discussion.},

Two versions of the weakly constrained filter, called the weakly constrained ensemble Kalman filter (WCEnKF) and the weakly constrained ensemble transform Kalman filter (WCETKF), are proposed. The strength of the weak constraint is adaptive in the sense that it depends on the statistical characteristics of the forecast ensemble. The resulting filters are applied to assimilate synthetic observations generated by the Noah land surface model over the Red Arkansas River basin. The data assimilation experiments demonstrate that, for all tested scenarios, the constrained filters produce analyses with nearly the same accuracy as unconstrained filters, but with much smaller water balance residuals than unconstrained filters. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This study provides an updated analysis of the evolution of seasonal rainfall intensity in the Amazon basin, considering the 1981–2017 period and based on HOP (interpolated HYBAM observed precipitation) and CHIRPS (The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations) rainfall data sets. Dry and wet day frequencies as well as extreme percentiles are used in this analysis, producing the same results. Dry-day frequency (DDF) significantly increases in the Southern Amazon (p < 0.01), particularly during September–November (SON) in the Bolivian Amazon, central Peruvian Amazon and far southern Brazilian Amazon. Consistently, total rainfall in the southern Amazon during SON also shows a significant diminution (p < 0.05), estimated at 18%. The increase in SON DDF in the southern Amazon is related to a warming of the northern tropical Atlantic Ocean and a weakening of water vapour flux from the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The increase in DDF in the southern Amazon is related to enhanced wind subsidence (ascendance) over the 10°S–20°S (5°S–5°N) region and to a deficit (excess) of specific humidity at 1000–300 hPa south of 10°S (north of the 5°S), which suggest a reduction of deep convection over southern Amazonia. Subsidence over the southern Amazon shows a significant trend (p < 0.01), which can explain the significant increase in DDF. Wet-day frequency (WDF) significantly increases in the northern Amazon, particularly during the March–May (MAM) period (p < 0.01), producing an estimated rainfall increase during MAM of 17% (p < 0.01) between 1981 and 2017. Significant changes in both WDF and rainfall in northern Amazon have been detected in 1998 (p < 0.01). After 1998, the increase in MAM WDF and rainfall is explained by enhanced moisture flux from the tropical North Atlantic Ocean and an increase in deep convection over the northern and northwestern Amazon. These evolutions in DDF and WDF and in the tropical atmosphere occur simultaneously with an increase in sea surface temperature in the northern Atlantic Ocean, particularly after the mid-1990s. These results provide new insight into rainfall variability and climatic features related to increasing dry season length in southern Amazonia. Severe recent droughts may be associated with the increase in DDF in the South. In addition, the increase in MAM rainfall intensity in northern Amazon after 1998 may be associated with several historical floods that occurred after this date.},

abstract = {Speckle filtering is an unavoidable step when dealing with applications that involve amplitude or intensity images acquired by coherent systems, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Speckle is a target-dependent phenomenon; thus, its estimation and reduction require the individuation of specific properties of the image features. Speckle filtering is one of the most prominent topics in the SAR image processing research community, who has first tackled this issue using handcrafted feature-based filters. Even if classical algorithms have slowly and progressively achieved better and better performance, the more recent Convolutional-Neural-Networks (CNNs) have proven to be a promising alternative, in the light of the outstanding capabilities in efficiently learning task-specific filters. Currently, only simplistic CNN architectures have been exploited for the speckle filtering task. While these architectures outperform classical algorithms, they still show some weakness in the texture preservation. In this work, a deep encoder-decoder CNN architecture, focused in the specific context of SAR images, is proposed in order to enhance speckle filtering capabilities alongside texture preservation. This objective has been addressed through the adaptation of the U-Net CNN, which has been modified and optimized accordingly. This architecture allows for the extraction of features at different scales, and it is capable of producing detailed reconstructions through its system of skip connections. In this work, a two-phase learning strategy is adopted, by first pre-training the model on a synthetic dataset and by adapting the learned network to the real SAR image domain through a fast fine-tuning procedure. During the fine-tuning phase, a modified version of the total variation (TV) regularization was introduced to improve the network performance when dealing with real SAR data. Finally, experiments were carried out on simulated and real data to compare the performance of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art methodologies.},

We focus on the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, located at the southern edge of the so-called "Legal Amazon" which has undergone intense land cover transformation in the last 4 decades. The annual cycle of mean convective activity described by AMSU and TRMM are in good agreement, with a correlation close to 0.80. The mean amplitude of convective activity is maximal early in the rainy season, except for AMSU deep convective area, which presents a maximum in January. The diurnal cycle of convection was examined for the period 2003 to 2007, and it was found that convection is maximal near 1500 local time (LT) and minimal around 0700 LT. Unlike the amplitude, the phase shows little intraseasonal and interannual variability. A slight decrease in convective activity in the studied period was found, possibly indicating an extension of the dry season. Comparisons of convective activity between deforested and forested areas showed no significant differences in the phase of the diurnal cycle, but our analysis shows a tendency for increase (decrease) in convection in deforested (forested) areas for the period considered. A longer time series is however necessary in order to strengthen the robustness of our results. {\textcopyright}2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

Using simulated datasets for which the errors and their correlations among the datasets are known, this analysis shows the conditions under which the 3CH method provides the most and least accurate estimates. The effect of representativeness errors caused by differences in vertical resolution of datasets is investigated.

abstract = {Studies that relate changes in land cover with changes in river discharge at the small scale (< 1 km2) are abundant. These studies generally indicate that deforestation causes an increase in the annual mean discharge. However, previous studies that evaluated the effects of changes in land cover in larger river basins (> 100 km2) usually have not found similar relationships. Here we analyse a 50-year long time series of discharge of a tropical river, the Tocantins River at Porto Nacional (175,360 km2), as well as precipitation over this drainage area, during a period where substantial changes in land cover occurred in the basin (1949-1998). Based on agricultural census data, we estimate that, in 1960, about 30% of the basin was used for agriculture. Previous work indicates that by 1995, agriculture had increased substantially, with about 49% of the basin land used as cropland and pastures. Initially, we compare one period with little changes in land cover (period 1-1949-1968) with another with more intense changes in land cover (period 2-1979-1998). Our analysis indicates that, while precipitation over the basin is not statistically different between period 1 and period 2 ($\alpha$ = 0.05), annual mean discharge in period 2 is 24% greater than in period 1 (P < 0.02), and the high-flow season discharge is greater by 28% (P < 0.01). Further analyses present additional evidence that the change in vegetation cover altered the hydrological response of this region. As the pressure for changes in land cover in that region continue to increase, one can expect important further changes in the hydrological regime of the Tocantins River. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier B.V.

The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission's observations represent a remarkable tool that can provide insight into the dynamics of terrestrial hydrology in areas where direct in situ observations are limited. In order to evaluate the impact of interannual and multidecadal climate variability on groundwater resources, this study assesses the relationship between synoptic controls on climate and total water storage estimates from (i) GRACE from 2002 to 2013 and (ii) a two-variable climate-driven model that is able to reconstruct past storage changes from 1982 to 2011. The estimates are then compared to time series of groundwater levels to show the extent to which total water storage covaries with groundwater storage. Results indicate that rainfall patterns associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are the main driver of changes in interannual groundwater storage, whereas the Atlantic MultiDecadal Oscillation (AMO) plays a significant role in decadal to multidecadal variability. The combined effect of ENSO and AMO could trigger significant changes in recharge to the aquifers and groundwater storage, in particular in the Sahel. These findings could help decision-makers prepare more effective climate-change adaptation plans at both national and transboundary levels.},

abstract = {Although mining plays an important role for the economy of the Amazon, little is known about its attributes such as area, type, scale, and current status as well as socio/environmental impacts. Therefore, we first propose a low time-consuming and high detection accuracy method for mapping the current mining areas within 13 regions of the Brazilian Amazon using Sentinel-2 images. Then, integrating the maps in a GIS (Geography Information System) environment, mining attributes for each region were further assessed with the aid of the DNPM (National Department for Mineral Production) database. Detection of the mining area was conducted in five main steps. (a) MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument)/Sentinel-2A (S2A) image selection; (b) definition of land-use classes and training samples; (c) supervised classification; (d) vector editing for quality control; and (e) validation with high-resolution RapidEye images (Kappa = 0.70). Mining areas derived from validated S2A classification totals 1084.7 km2 in the regions analyzed. Small-scale mining comprises up to 64% of total mining area detected comprises mostly gold (617.8 km2), followed by tin mining (73.0 km2). The remaining 36% is comprised by industrial mining such as iron (47.8), copper (55.5) and manganese (8.9 km2) in Caraj{\'{a}}s, bauxite in Trombetas (78.4) and Rio Capim (48.5 km2). Given recent events of mining impacts, the large extension of mining areas detected raises a concern regarding its socio-environmental impacts for the Amazonian ecosystems and for local communities.},

abstract = {The long time scale of soil moisture dynamics makes it a potentially important predictor in seasonal to interannual precipitation predictions. However, where and to what extent soil moisture can influence precipitation is still a topic of debate. A feedback parameter was applied by several studies to quantify both the magnitude and direction of soil moisture's impacts on precipitation based on both observational data and model output. Its effectiveness as an indicator of soil moisture impact on precipitation was questioned in recent studies. Using the NCAR CAM3-CLM3 as a modeling framework, this study examines whether the feedback parameter can correctly identify regions of strong soil moisture impact on precipitation as compared with other more physically based numerical experimental designs. It is found that the effectiveness of feedback parameter as an indicator for soil moisture impact on precipitation is significantly reduced by the presence of low-frequency precipitation variability. Such low-frequency variability (which may be caused by large scale oceanic forcing) propagates to the land surface, causing similar variability in soil moisture, and the presence of the low-frequency signal in both variables leads to spuriously large feedback parameter values. Our results suggest that the feedback parameter is not a reliable indicator for the impact of soil moisture on precipitation.},

abstract = {Water siltation caused by artisanal gold mining has impacted the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River Basin in Brazil for the past 40. years, however spatial-temporal information about changes in water quality and consequences to the aquatic environment is lacking. To address this, the Landsat satellite family sensors were used to retrieve total suspended solids (TSS) of the water of the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River from 1973 to 2013. An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed.},

abstract = {<p>Abstract. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of the ORCHIDEE land surface model to simulate streamflows over each sub-basin of the Amazon River basin. For this purpose, simulations are performed with a routing module including the influence of floodplains and swamps on river discharge and validated against on-site hydrological measurements collected within the HYBAM observatory over the 1980–2000 period. When forced by the NCC global meteorological dataset, the initial version of ORCHIDEE shows discrepancies with ORE HYBAM measurements with underestimation by 15% of the annual mean streamflow at {\'{O}}bidos hydrological station. Consequently, several improvements are incrementally added to the initial simulation in order to reduce those discrepancies. First, values of NCC precipitation are substituted by ORE HYBAM daily in-situ rainfall observations from the meteorological services of Amazonian countries, interpolated over the basin. It highly improves the simulated streamflow over the northern and western parts of the basin, whereas streamflow over southern regions becomes overestimated, probably due to the extension of rainy spots that may be exaggerated by our interpolation method, or to an underestimation of simulated evapotranspiration when compared to flux tower measurements. Second, the initial map of maximal fractions of floodplains and swamps which largely underestimates floodplains areas over the main stem of the Amazon River and over the region of Llanos de Moxos in Bolivia, is substituted by a new one with a better agreement with different estimates over the basin. Simulated monthly water height is consequently better represented in ORCHIDEE when compared to Topex/Poseidon measurements over the main stem of the Amazon. Finally, a calibration of the time constant of the floodplain reservoir is performed to adjust the mean simulated seasonal peak flow at {\'{O}}bidos in agreement with the observations.</p>},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to improve the understanding of the spatial dynamics of evapotranspiration (ET) with a focus on the influence of the current level of Amazonian deforestation through comparative statistics of different land cover. The study area comprised the state of Rond{\^{o}}nia, Brazil, which was subdivided into homogeneous regions regarding ET using cluster analysis. In addition, we analyzed the use of a logistic regression model to create deforestation maps in the Amazon based on ET fields. We used orbital data on ET and land cover type from the MOD16 product and the Amazon Forest Satellite Monitoring Project (PRODES), respectively, considering the period from 2000 to 2014. The cluster analysis results showed that for the study area, three homogeneous sub-regions were sufficient to represent the ET variability, mainly considering the intensity and seasonal pattern of this process. Regarding the impacts after changing from forest to deforested area, the analyses indicated that the ET of deforested areas decreased by an average of 28% in the dry period and increased by 4% in the rainy season. The effects observed in the rainy season were not significant at 5% significance according to the Student t-test, unlike the dry period, which presented statistical significance (p-value <0.05). In general, the results indicated that MOD16 data can provide a satisfactory representation of the change in ET in large areas of the Brazilian Amazon. Logistic regression analysis showed that the spatial pattern of deforestation can be identified by biophysical factors such as ET with 87% accuracy, despite the spatial/temporal variability present in the region. These results support this approach as an effective tool for spatial identification of Amazonian deforestation.},

abstract = {Geostationary satellites have now been providing weather data for 50 years. Much of these data have been neglected by climate observation studies due to difficulties with calibration and data processing over such a long period. Collection and data ownership rights were spread out across several international agencies. The ISCCP project is overcoming these barriers and this paper has presented details on the most up-to-date and easily accessible global satellite record: GridSat. This new record provides equal-angle gridded uniform observations of brightness temperatures every 3 h from 1980 to the present for most of the globe. We have demonstrated the multiple and diverse uses of the data for climate analysis made possible by GridSat data-from predicting drought and food security in Africa to the detailed and historical tracking of hurricanes. This only touches on some of the potential uses of GridSat. Accurate records of global atmospheric fields are essential for future research on climate change as well as the understanding of the planet's meteorology. By reconstructing past satellite data and combining them with current satellite observations, a seamless data record has been obtained for the study of Earth's atmospheric state. In addition, GridSat has given a wide range of users very easy access to this new data record. Development of GridSat will continue, focusing on improving the current data files and supporting more applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

We also describe the coupling of MGB-IPH to an open source GIS and a large set of developed pre-processing tools with a user-friendly interface for remote sensing data preparation and output visualization. The new features implemented are demonstrated applying the model to the whole Araguaia river basin (380,000 km2). Results are compared to the previous MGB-IPH routing method, observed flow and water level data and remote sensing imagery, showing improvement in the representation of floodplain inundation dynamics. The test case also shows that the proposed model software framework amplifies possibilities of large-scale simulation of ungauged basins.},

abstract = {We assess the water balance of the Brazilian Cerrado based on remotely sensed estimates of precipitation (TRMM), evapotranspiration (MOD16), and terrestrial water storage (GRACE) for the period from 2003 to 2010. Uncertainties for each remotely sensed data set were computed, the budget closure was evaluated using measured discharge data for the three largest river basins in the Cerrado, and the Mann-Kendall test was used to evaluate temporal trends in the water balance components and measured river discharge. The results indicate an overestimation of discharge data, due mainly to the overestimation of rainfall by TRMM version 6. However, better results were obtained when the new release of TRMM 3B42 v7 was used instead. Our results suggest that there have been (a) significant increases in average annual evapotranspiration over the entire Cerrado of 51 ± 15 mm yr-1, (b) terrestrial water storage increases of 11 ± 6 mm yr-1 in the northeast region of the Brazilian Cerrado, and (c) runoff decreases of 72 ± 11 mm yr-1 in isolated spots and in the western part of the State of Mato Grosso. Although complete water budget closure from remote sensing remains a significant challenge due to uncertainties in the data, it provides a useful way to evaluate trends in major water balance components over large regions, identify dry periods, and assess changes in water balance due to land cover and land use change.},

abstract = {Wind is a very important geophysical variable to accurately measure. However, a statistical phenomenon important for the validation or calibration of winds is the small dynamic range relative to the typical measurement uncertainty, i.e., the generally small signal-to-noise ratio. In such cases, pseudobiases may occur when standard validation or calibration methods are applied, such as regression or bin-average analyses. Moreover, nonlinear transformation of random error, for instance, between wind components and speed and direction, may give rise to substantial pseudobiases. In fact, validation or calibration can only be done properly when the full error characteristics of the data are known. In practice, the problem is that prior knowledge on the error characteristics is seldom available. In this paper we show that simultaneous error modeling and calibration can be achieved by using triple collocations. Tliis is a fundamental finding tliat is generally relevant to all geophysical validation. To illustrate the statistical analysis using triple collocations, in situ, ERS scatterometer, and forecast model winds are used. Wind component error analysis is shown to be more convenient than wind speed and direction error analysis. The anemometer winds from the National Oceanic and Atmosplieric Administration (NOAA) buoys are shown to have the largest error variance, followed by the scatterometer and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) forecast model winds proved the most accurate. When using the in situ winds as a reference, the scatterometer wind components are biased low by -4%. The NCEP forecast model winds are found to be biased high by -6%. After applying a higher-order calibration procedure an improved ERS scatterometer wind retrieval is proposed The systematic and random error analysis is relevant for the use of nearsurface winds to compute fluxes of momentum, humidity, or heat or to drive ocean wave or circulation models.

abstract = {In this study, the spatial and temporal variabilities of terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and snow water equivalent anomaly (SWEA) information obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellites data were analysed in conjunction with multisource snow products over several basins in the Canadian landmass. Snow water equivalent (SWE) data were extracted from three different sources: Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research version 2 (GlobSnow2), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), and Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC). The objective of the study was to understand whether SWE variations have a significant contribution to terrestrial water storage anomalies in the Canadian landmass. The period was considered from December 2002 to March 2011. Significant relationships were observed between TWSA and SWEA for most of the 15 basins considered (53% to 80% of the basins, depending on the SWE products considered). The best results were obtained with the CMC SWE products compared with satellite-based SWE data. Stronger relationships were found in snow-dominated basins (Rs > = 0.7), such as the Liard [root mean square error (RMSE) = 21.4 mm] and Peace Basins (RMSE = 26.76 mm). However, despite high snow accumulation in the north of Quebec, GRACE showed weak or insignificant correlations with SWEA, regardless of the data sources. The same behaviour was observed in the Western Hudson Bay basin. In both regions, it was found that the contribution of non-SWE compartments including wetland, surface water, as well as soil water storages has a significant impact on the variations of total storage. These components were estimated using the Water-Global Assessment and Prognosis Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) simulations and then subtracted from GRACE observations. The GRACE-derived SWEA correlation results showed improved relationships with three SWEA products. The improvement is particularly important in the sub-basins of the Hudson Bay, where very weak and insignificant results were previously found with GRACE TWSA data. GRACE-derived SWEA showed a significant relationship with CMC data in 93% of the basins (13% more than GRACE TWSA). Overall, the results indicated the important role of SWE on terrestrial water storage variations.},

abstract = {This paper describes a newalgorithmthat is able to detect snowfall and retrieve the associated snow water path (SWP), for any surface type, using the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI). The algorithm is tuned and evaluated against coincident observations of the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) onboard CloudSat. It is composed of three modules for (i) snowfall detection, (ii) supercooled droplet detection and (iii) SWP retrieval. This algorithm takes into account environmental conditions to retrieve SWP and does not rely on any surface classification scheme. The snowfall detection module is able to detect 83% of snowfall events including light SWP (down to 1 × 10-3 kg{\textperiodcentered}m-2) with a false alarm ratio of 0.12. The supercooled detection module detects 97% of events, with a false alarm ratio of 0.05. The SWP estimates show a relative bias of -11%, a correlation of 0.84 and a root mean square error of 0.04 kg{\textperiodcentered}m-2. Several applications of the algorithm are highlighted: Three case studies of snowfall events are investigated, and a 2-year high resolution 70°S-70°N snowfall occurrence distribution is presented. These results illustrate the high potential of this algorithm for snowfall detection and SWP retrieval using GMI.},

abstract = {Global climate change and anthropogenic impacts lead to alterations in the water cycle, water resource availability and the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. As a result, developing effective techniques such as hydrological modeling is essential to monitor and predict water storage changes. However, inaccuracies and uncertainties in different aspects of modeling, due to simplification of meteorological physical processes, data limitations and inaccurate climate forcing data limit the reliability of hydrological models. Satellite remote sensing datasets, especially Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) data which can be obtained from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), provide a new and valuable source of data which can augment our understanding of the hydrologic cycle. Merging these new observations with hydrological models can effectively enhance the model performance using advanced statistical and numerical methods, which is known as data assimilation. Assimilation of new observations constrain the dynamics of the model based on uncertainties associated with both model and data, which can introduce missing water storage signals e.g., anthropogenic and extreme climate change effects. Assimilation of GRACE TWS data into hydrological models is a challenging task as provision should be made for handling the errors and then merging them with hydrological models using efficient assimilation techniques. The goal of this paper is to provide an in-depth overview of recent studies on assimilating GRACE TWS data into hydrological models and shed light on their limitations, challenges and progress. We present a comprehensive review of some challenges with GRACE TWS data assimilation into a hydrological model including GRACE TWS errors e.g., the correlated noise of high-frequency mass variations and spatial leakage errors, and how to work with GRACE TWS data errors to use the potential of GRACE TWS data as much as possible. We provide a review of the benefits and limitations of available data assimilation techniques with emphasis on the capability of sequential methods for hydrological applications.},

abstract = {<p>Abstract. The process whereby the spatially distributed runoff (generated through saturation/infiltration excesses, subsurface flow, etc.) travels over the hillslope and river network and becomes streamflow is generally referred to as "routing". In short, routing is a runoff-to-streamflow process, and the streamflow in rivers is the response to runoff integrated in both time and space. Here we develop a methodology to invert the routing process, i.e., to derive the spatially distributed runoff from streamflow (e.g., measured at gauge stations) by inverting an arbitrary linear routing model using fixed interval smoothing. We refer to this streamflow-to-runoff process as "inverse routing". Inversion experiments are performed using both synthetically generated and real streamflow measurements over the Ohio River basin. Results show that inverse routing can effectively reproduce the spatial field of runoff and its temporal dynamics from sufficiently dense gauge measurements, and the inversion performance can also be strongly affected by low gauge density and poor data quality. The runoff field is the only component in the terrestrial water budget that cannot be directly measured, and all previous studies used streamflow measurements in its place. Consequently, such studies are limited to scales where the spatial and temporal difference between the two can be ignored. Inverse routing provides a more sophisticated tool than traditional methods to bridge this gap and infer fine-scale (in both time and space) details of runoff from aggregated measurements. Improved handling of this final gap in terrestrial water budget analysis may potentially help us to use space-borne altimetry-based surface water measurements for cross-validating, cross-correcting, and assimilation with other space-borne water cycle observations.</p>},

The consequences of this vegetation-atmosphere feedback for the stability of the Amazon forest are still unclear. Here we show that the risk of self-amplified Amazon forest loss increases nonlinearly with dry-season intensification. We apply a novel complex-network approach, in which Amazon forest patches are linked by observation-based atmospheric water fluxes. Our results suggest that the risk of self-amplified forest loss is reduced with increasing heterogeneity in the response of forest patches to reduced rainfall. Under dry-season Amazonian rainfall reductions, comparable to Last Glacial Maximum conditions, additional forest loss due to self-amplified effects occurs in 10-13% of the Amazon basin. Although our findings do not indicate that the projected rainfall changes for the end of the twenty-first century will lead to complete Amazon dieback, they suggest that frequent extreme drought events have the potential to destabilize large parts of the Amazon forest.},

The model was then validated for both the Japanese Islands (using GMS and AMeDAS data) and the Florida peninsula (using GOES-8 and NEXRAD data).

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 by the authors. Data assimilation (DA) of satellite soil moisture (SM) observations represents a great opportunity for improving the ability of rainfall-runoffmodels in predicting river discharges. Many studies have been carried out so far demonstrating the possibility to reduce model prediction uncertainty by incorporating satellite SM observations. However, large discrepancies can be perceived between these studies with the result that successful DA is not only related to the quality of the satellite observations but can be significantly controlled by many methodological and morphoclimatic factors. In this article, through an experimental study carried out on the Tiber River basin in Central Italy, we explore how the catchment area, soil type, climatology, rescaling technique, observation and model error selection may affect the results of the assimilation and can be the causes of the apparent discrepancies obtained in the literature. The results show that: (i) DA of SM generally improves discharge predictions (with a mean efficiency of about 30%); (ii) unlike catchment area, the soil type and the catchment specific characteristics might have a remarkable influence on the results; (iii) simple rescaling techniques may perform equally well to more complex ones; (iv) an accurate quantification of the model error is paramount for a correct choice of the observation error and, (v) SM temporal variability has a stronger influence than the season itself. On this basis, we advise that DA of SM may be not a simple task and one should carefully test the optimality of the assimilation experiment prior to drawing any general conclusions.},

The current dataset serves as a state of the art in current global hydrological modelling and as a benchmark for further improvements in the coming years. A signal-to-noise ratio analysis revealed low inter-model agreement over (i) snow-dominated regions and (ii) tropical rainforest and monsoon areas. The large uncertainty of precipitation in the tropics is not reflected in the ensemble runoff. Verification of the results against benchmark datasets for evapotranspiration, snow cover, snow water equivalent, soil moisture anomaly and total water storage anomaly using the tools from The International Land Model Benchmarking Project (ILAMB) showed overall useful model performance, while the ensemble mean generally outperformed the single model estimates. The results also show that there is currently no single best model for all variables and that model performance is spatially variable. In our unconstrained model runs the ensemble mean of total runoff into the ocean was 46 268 km3 yr-1 (334 kgm-2 yr-1), while the ensemble mean of total evaporation was 537 kgm-2 yr-1.

abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has led to a remarkable breakthrough in object detection in remote sensing images. In practice, two-stage detectors perform well regarding detection accuracy but are slow. On the other hand, one-stage detectors integrate the detection pipeline of two-stage detectors to simplify the detection process, and are faster, but with lower detection accuracy. Enhancing the capability of feature representation may be a way to improve the detection accuracy of one-stage detectors. For this goal, this paper proposes a novel one-stage detector with enhanced capability of feature representation. The enhanced capability benefits from two proposed structures: dual top-down module and dense-connected inception module. The former efficiently utilizes multi-scale features from multiple layers of the backbone network. The latter both widens and deepens the network to enhance the ability of feature representation with limited extra computational cost. To evaluate the effectiveness of proposed structures, we conducted experiments on horizontal bounding box detection tasks on the challenging DOTA dataset and gained 73.49% mean Average Precision (mAP), achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our method ran significantly faster than the best public two-stage detector on the DOTA dataset.},

abstract = {Soil moisture is a key participant in land-atmosphere interactions and an important determinant of terrestrial climate. In regions where the water table is shallow, soil moisture is coupled to the water table. This paper is the first of a two-part study to quantify this coupling and explore its implications in the context of climate modeling. We examine the observed water table depth in the lower 48 states of the United States in search of salient spatial and temporal features that are relevant to climate dynamics. As a means to interpolate and synthesize the scattered observations, we use a simple two-dimensional groundwater flow model to construct an equilibrium water table as a result of long-term climatic and geologic forcing. Model simulations suggest that the water table depth exhibits spatial organization at watershed, regional, and continental scales, which may have implications for the spatial organization of soil moisture at similar scales. The observations suggest that water table depth varies at diurnal, event, seasonal, and interannual scales, which may have implications for soil moisture memory at these scales.

abstract = {The Lagrangian model FLEXPART is used to identify the moisture sources of the Congo River basin (CRB) and investigate their role in the hydrological cycle. This model allows us to track atmospheric parcels while calculating changes in the specific humidity through the budget of evaporation minus precipitation. This method permits the annual-scale identification of five continental and four oceanic principal regions that provide moisture to the CRB from both hemispheres over the course of the year. The most important is the CRB, which provides more than 50 % of the total atmospheric moisture contribution to precipitation over itself. Additionally, both the land that extends to the east of the CRB and the eastern equatorial South Atlantic Ocean are very important sources, while the Red Sea source is merely important in the (E - P) budget over the CRB despite its high evaporation rate. The moisture-sink patterns over the CRB in air masses that were tracked forward in time from all the sources follow the latitudinal rainfall migration and are mostly highly correlated with the pattern of the precipitation rate, ensuring a link between them. In wet (dry) years, the contribution of moisture to precipitation from the CRB over itself increases (decreases). Despite the enhanced evaporative conditions over the basin during dry years, the vertically integrated moisture flux (VIMF) divergence inhibits precipitation and suggests the transport of moisture from the CRB to remote regions.},

In the first step, cloud-free SSM/I observations are isolated with the help of collocated visible/infrared satellite observations (ISCCP data). The cloud-free atmospheric contribution is then calculated, from an estimate of the local atmospheric temperature-humidity profile (TOVS retrieval). Finally, with the surface skin temperature derived from IR observations (ISCCP estimate), the surface emissivity is calculated for all the SSM/I channels. As an exploration the method is applied to the SSM/I data for four months in 1991 within the Meteosat observation area. The magnitude and fluctuations of the atmospheric contributions are estimated along with the effect of surface temperature variations. Correspondences between geographical and seasonal patterns of the emissivities and topography, vegetation, flooding, and snow cover are analyzed. The potential for using microwave emissivities to monitor vegetation phenology and surface properties at regional and continental scale is investigated, and the possibility of retrieving atmospheric parameters (water vapor content, cloud liquid water path, and precipitation) over land is discussed.},

abstract = {Patterns of surface sediment concentration distribution in rivers are significant for understanding fluvial morphodynamics and environmental characteristics of the rivers and their floodplains. In the case of the Amazon Basin, complexity in sediment pattern distribution is affected by the anabranching channel pattern of the Amazon River, inputs from tributaries (some of which are among the largest rivers on Earth) and the existence of huge and complex floodplains. In this paper, patterns of surface sediment distribution are modeled based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over the Amazon River by estimating surface sediment concentrations. Specifically, we aim to 1) detect the regional and seasonal variability of surface sediment in the main channel, 2) observe the influence of tributaries into the main system, 3) identify channel-floodplain interactions, and 4) investigate the internal variability of surface sediment along the main channel system. Field surface sediment concentration data from three gauging stations representing the upstream, midstream, and downstream sections of the Amazon River between 2000 and 2010 were used to calibrate 1328 MODIS daily surface reflectance images. Robust empirical models were derived between field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data from each station (0.79<R2<0.92, slopes significant at 99% confidence level) from 752 selected data after quality control. We applied empirical models to 2112 8-day composite surface reflectance images to generate surface sediment distribution maps since 2000. Overall, this study successfully demonstrated the capability of our MODIS-based model to capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface sediments in the Amazon River Basin, the largest river system on Earth. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Different satellite rainfall products are used in different applications over different parts of the world. These products are particularly important over many parts of Africa, where they are used to augment the very sparse rain-gauge network. However, the quality of the different satellite products varies from one product to another and from one climatic region to another. The climate over eastern Africa varies from wet coastal and mountainous regions to dry arid regions. Significant variations could be observed within short distances. The different climates will pose different challenges to satellite rainfall retrieval over this region. This study explores the effect of mountainous and arid climates on four different satellite rainfall-estimation (RFE) algorithms. The mountainous climate is located over the Ethiopian highlands, while the arid region covers parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. One infrared-only product, African rainfall climatology (ARC), one passive-microwave-only product (the Climate Prediction Center morphing technique, CMORPH) and two products (the RFE algorithm and the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM-3B42)), which combine both infrared and passive-microwave estimates, are used for this investigation. All the products exhibit moderate underestimation of rainfall over the highlands of Ethiopia, while the overestimation over the dry region is found to be very high. The underestimation over the mountainous region is ascribed to the warm orographic rain process, while the overestimation over the dry region may be because of sub-cloud evaporation. Local calibration of satellite algorithms and merging of satellite estimates with all locally available rain-gauge observations are some of the approaches that could be employed to alleviate these problems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Water is a naturally circulating resource that is constantly recharged. Therefore, even though the stocks of water in natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful to increase the available water resources for human society, the flow of water should be the main focus in water resources assessments. The climate system puts an upper limit on the circulation rate of available renewable freshwater resources (RFWR). Although current global withdrawals are well below the upper limit, more than two billion people live in highly water-stressed areas because of the uneven distribution of RFWR in time and space. Climate change is expected to accelerate water cycles and thereby increase the available RFWR. This would slow down the increase of people living under water stress; however, changes in seasonal patterns and increasing probability of extreme events may offset this effect. Reducing current vulnerability will be the first step to prepare for such anticipated changes.},

abstract = {Current global precipitation (P) datasets do not take full advantage of the complementary nature of satellite and reanalysis data. Here, we present Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) version 1.1, a global P dataset for the period 1979–2015 with a 3-hourly temporal and 0.25° spatial resolution, specifically designed for hydrological modeling. The design philosophy of MSWEP was to optimally merge the highest quality P data sources available as a function of timescale and location. The long-term mean of MSWEP was based on the CHPclim dataset but replaced with more accurate regional datasets where available. A correction for gauge under-catch and orographic effects was introduced by inferring catchment-average P from streamflow (Q) observations at 13 762 stations across the globe. The temporal variability of MSWEP was determined by weighted averaging of P anomalies from seven datasets; two based solely on interpolation of gauge observations (CPC Unified and GPCC), three on satellite remote sensing (CMORPH, GSMaP-MVK, and TMPA 3B42RT), and two on atmospheric model reanalysis (ERA-Interim and JRA-55). For each grid cell, the weight assigned to the gauge-based estimates was calculated from the gauge network density, while the weights assigned to the satellite- and reanalysis-based estimates were calculated from their comparative performance at the surrounding gauges. The quality of MSWEP was compared against four state-of-the-art gauge-adjusted P datasets (WFDEI-CRU, GPCP-1DD, TMPA 3B42, and CPC Unified) using independent P data from 125 FLUXNET tower stations around the globe. MSWEP obtained the highest daily correlation coefficient (R) among the five P datasets for 60.0 % of the stations and a median R of 0.67 vs. 0.44–0.59 for the other datasets. We further evaluated the performance of MSWEP using hydrological modeling for 9011 catchments (< 50 000 km2) across the globe. Specifically, we calibrated the simple conceptual hydrological model HBV (Hydrologiska Byr{\aa}ns Vattenbalansavdelning) against daily Q observations with P from each of the different datasets. For the 1058 sparsely gauged catchments, representative of 83.9 % of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), MSWEP obtained a median calibration NSE of 0.52 vs. 0.29–0.39 for the other P datasets. MSWEP is available via http://www.gloh2o.org.},

Cloud contamination, although less of an issue at MW than at visible to infrared wavelengths, may adversely affect retrieval quality, particularly in the presence of strong cloud formation (convective towers) or precipitation. To limit errors associated with cloud contamination, we present an index derived from stand-alone MW brightness temperature observations, which measure the probability of residual cloud contamination. The method uses a statistical neural network model trained with the Global Precipitation Microwave Imager (GMI) observations and a cloud classification from Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI). This index is available over land and ocean and is developed for multiple frequency ranges to be applicable to successive generations of MW imagers. The index confidence increases with the number of available frequencies and performs better over the ocean, as expected. In all cases, even for the more challenging radiometric signatures over land, the model reaches an accuracy of ≥70 % in detecting contaminated observations. Finally an application of this index is shown that eliminates grid cells unsuitable for land surface temperature estimation.]]></p>},

abstract = {Based on nine years (1983-91) of infrared data from geostationary satellites (the B3 ISCCP product), several features of the diurnal march of the frequency of convective cloudiness over the tropical and subtropical Americas are documented with3-h temporal resolution and 0.5° × 0.5° latitude-longitude spatial resoluton. The frequency of convective cloudiness in each grid box is defined in terms of the fraction of temporal samples that exhibit cloud-top temperatures colder than 235 K. The effect of varying the threshold is explored and selected results are compared with rainfall estimates based on microwave (SSM/I) imagery. Convective cloudiness over most land areas exhibits a coherent diurnal march with relatively clear mornings, a rapid afternoon buildup, and a more gradual nighttime decay. The highest, coldest convective clouds peak a few hours earlier than those with lower tops. Morning to nootime maxtima tend to be prevalent over offshore waters that experience significant convection such as the Gulf of Panama, with the highest convective clouds leading the lower ones by 6 h or more. During the austral summer, the strongest diurnal march is observed over the Andes Mountains, in a band just inland of the northeast coast of South America and in two intermediate, parallel bands over Amazonia. Between these bands, weak night and morning maxima are observed in some areas. During the boreal summer the strongest diurnal march is observed over Central America and extending northwest along the continental divide as far as the southwestern United States. In comparison to the microwave imagery, the features in convective cloudiness tend to be somewhat larger in spatial scale, and cloudiness over land tends to be biased toward the late afternoon and evening hours. Regions with strong late afternoon/early evening maxima in vonvective cloudiness tend to experience more diurnal-mean convective cloudiness than those with weak (or morning) maxima. Although the evidence is less conclusive, it appears that the same may be true of rainfall. On the basis of these results it is suggested that over regions of relatively flat terrain such as Amazonia, the dynamics of the diurnal march may play a role in determining the spatial distribution of climatolgical-mean rainfall.},

Venezuela is a country highly vulnerable to extreme weather events such as extensive droughts and flash floods; therefore, an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of satellite-based rainfall products is useful for the planning of water resources. Using numerical metrics in order to evaluate performance, monthly rainfall estimates, from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation and Stations (CHIRPS v.2) product, are compared to gauge data from the 1981-2007 interval and categorical metrics for assessing rain-detection skills. The analysis was performed considering different rainfall categories, seasonality, and spatial context. The results show that the satellite product CHIRPS v.2 overestimates (underestimates) low (high) monthly rainfall values; although on the majority of numerical metrics of skill shows a good performance. This product, on the other hand, achieves better performance during the rainy season (April-September), significantly overestimating, however, the rainfall-events frequency. The product also shows best overall performance over flat and open regions (e.g., Los Llanos), where precipitation is influenced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone activity and local convective systems.},

In this paper, we discussed the predictability of WSE by a global hydrodynamics model, which is required as a dynamic core for global-scale data assimilation using SWOT. From the comparison against WSE observed by the altimeter on Envisat, we found that the up-to-date global hydrodynamics model is able to reproduce the seasonal variations of WSE in the Amazon River, though predicted WSE still has errors due to the uncertainties in topographic parameters and sub-grid-scale dynamics of the model. Reduction of these uncertainties is required along with the development of the algorithm itself for achieving global-scale data assimilation of WSE. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. -from Author},

abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is difficult to measure at the scales of climate models and climate variability. While satellite retrieval algorithms do exist, their accuracy is limited by the sparseness of in situ observations available for calibration and validation, which themselves may be unrepresentative of 500m and larger scale satellite footprints and grid pixels. Here, we use a combination of satellite and ground-based observations to close the water budgets of seven continental scale river basins (Mackenzie, Fraser, Nelson, Mississippi, Tocantins, Danube, and Ubangi), estimating mean ET as a residual. For any river basin, ET must equal total precipitation minus net runoff minus the change in total terrestrial water storage (TWS), in order for mass to be conserved. We make use of precipitation from two global observation-based products, archived runoff data, and TWS changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. We demonstrate that while uncertainty in the water budget-based estimates of monthly ET is often too large for those estimates to be useful, the uncertainty in the mean annual cycle is small enough that it is practical for evaluating other ET products. Here, we evaluate five land surface model simulations, two operational atmospheric analyses, and a recent global reanalysis product based on our results. An important outcome is that the water budget-based ET time series in two tropical river basins, one in Brazil and the other in central Africa, exhibit a weak annual cycle, which may help to resolve debate about the strength of the annual cycle of ET in such regions and how ET is constrained throughout the year. The methods described will be useful for water and energy budget studies, weather and climate model assessments, and satellite-based ET retrieval optimization.

abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems dominate the coastal wetlands of tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. They provide various ecological and economical ecosystem services contributing to coastal erosion protection, water filtration, provision of areas for fish and shrimp breeding, provision of building material and medicinal ingredients, and the attraction of tourists, amongst many other factors. At the same time, mangroves belong to the most threatened and vulnerable ecosystems worldwide and experienced a dramatic decline during the last half century. International programs, such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands or the Kyoto Protocol, underscore the importance of immediate protection measures and conservation activities to prevent the further loss of mangroves. In this context, remote sensing is the tool of choice to provide spatio-temporal information on mangrove ecosystem distribution, species differentiation, health status, and ongoing changes of mangrove populations. Such studies can be based on various sensors, ranging from aerial photography to high- and medium-resolution optical imagery and from hyperspectral data to active microwave (SAR) data. Remote-sensing techniques have demonstrated a high potential to detect, identify, map, and monitor mangrove conditions and changes during the last two decades, which is reflected by the large number of scientific papers published on this topic. To our knowledge, a recent review paper on the remote sensing of mangroves does not exist, although mangrove ecosystems have become the focus of attention in the context of current climate change and discussions of the services provided by these ecosystems. Also, climate change-related remote-sensing studies in coastal zones have increased drastically in recent years. The aim of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive overview and sound summary of all of the work undertaken, addressing the variety of remotely sensed data applied for mangrove ecosystem mapping, as well as the numerous methods and techniques used for data analyses, and to further discuss their potential and limitations.},

Here we investigate trends in O in the state of Rondonia, Brazil, a region that has been continuously deforested since the 1970s. Daily rainfall data from 16 station time series, spanning periods of at least 25 years, with five covering more than 30 years, are used. We define O as the first day after 1 September with rainfall greater than 20 mm d−1 . A t test indicates that for stations that lie inside the major deforested area, O has significantly shifted to, on average, 11 days (and up to 18 days) later in the year over the last three decades. However, for stations that lie in areas that have not been heavily deforested, O has not shifted significantly. Nonparametric and parametric trend analyses all gave similar results for the change of O with time, and all of the statistically significant results indicated a delay in O. Twentyfive percent (four) of the stations analyzed showed a marked shift in timing of O: these stations are located inside deforested areas, primarily near the BR 364 highway that crosses Rondonia. Delayed onset may be a result of land use change, and this signal may strengthen in future: current delaying trends may be as great as 0.6 days per year, and after 30 years of deforestation the onset of the rainy season is expected to be 18 days later.},

abstract = {The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), features several major advances from the original MERRA reanalysis, including the use, outside of high latitudes, of observations-based precipitation data products to correct the precipitation falling on the land surface in the MERRA-2 system. The method for merging the observed precipitation into MERRA-2 has been refined from that of the (land-only) MERRA-Land reanalysis. This paper describes the method and evaluates the MERRA-2 land surface precipitation. Compared to monthly GPCPv2.2 observations, the corrected MERRA-2 precipitation (M2CORR) is better than the precipitation generated by the atmospheric models within the cycling MERRA-2 and MERRA systems. M2CORR is also better than MERRA-Land precipitation over Africa because in MERRA-2 a merged satellite-gauge precipitation product is used instead of the gauge-only data used for MERRA-Land. Compared to 3-hourly TRMM observations, the M2CORR diurnal cycle has better amplitude but less realistic phasing than MERRA-2 model-generated precipitation. Because correcting the precipitation within the coupled atmosphere-land modeling system allows the MERRA-2 near-surface air temperature and humidity to respond to the improved precipitation forcing, MERRA-2 provides more self-consistent surface meteorological data than were available from MERRA-Land, which is important for applications such as landonly modeling studies.Where precipitation observations of sufficient quality are available for use in the reanalysis, the corrections facilitate the seamless spinup of the land surface initial conditions across theMERRA-2 production streams. At high latitudes, however, the lack of reliable precipitation observations results in undesirable land spinup effects that impact mostly the first published year of eachMERRA-2 stream (1980, 1992, 2001, and 2011).},

Therefore, accurate, high-resolution estimates of terrestrial water and energy storages are valuable for predicting climate change, weather, biological and agricultural productivity, and flooding, and for performing a wide array of studies in the broader biogeosciences. In particular, terrestrial stores of energy and water modulate fluxes between the land and atmosphere and exhibit persistence on diurnal, seasonal, and interannual time scales. Furthermore, because soil moisture, temperature, and snow are integrated states, biases in land surface forcing data and parameterizations accumulate as errors in the representations of these states in operational numerical weather forecast and climate models and their associated coupled data assimilation systems. That leads to incorrect surface water and energy partitioning , and, hence, inaccurate predictions. Reinitialization of land surface states would mollify this problem if the land surface fields were reliable and available globally, at high spatial resolution, and in near-real time. A Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) has been developed jointly by scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in order to produce such fields.

abstract = {Remote sensing is a useful tool for observing the water cycle. However, combining remote sensing products over any major river basin will result in a residual error in the overall water balance. Previous studies have either quantified this error without correcting it, or have merged observations together with land surface models (LSMs) to produce a single “best” estimate of the water balance. Here, we present a new approach in which combinations of remote sensing and in situ observations are constrained to enforce water balance closure. Rather than a single estimate, this produces an ensemble of unique water balance estimates intended to characterize uncertainty and to avoid biases implicit in LSMs. We evaluate three techniques of varying complexity to enforce water balance closure for individual ensemble members over 24 global basins from Oct. 2002 - Dec. 2014, resulting in as many as 60 realizations of the monthly water budget, contingent upon data availability. Compared with a published climate data record, the ensemble shows strong agreement for precipitation, evapotranspiration and changes in storage (R2: 0.91–0.95), with less agreement for streamflow (R2: 0.42–0.47), which may be indicative of LSM biases in the climate data record. Water balance residual errors resulting from combinations of raw products vary significantly (p < 0.001) with latitude, with a tendency for positive biases for low- and mid-latitude basins, and negative biases elsewhere. Overall, residual errors are equivalent to 15% of total precipitation when averaged across all data products and basins. This study shows that closure constraints provide additional value outside of closing the water budget, including reduction of uncertainty and transfer of closure constraints in time to provide skillful estimates of mean annual basin discharge. We also showed that a simpler closure technique, proportional redistribution, performed better than more complex ones in decreasing uncertainty and for transfer through time to estimate basin discharge when a rigorous analysis of errors for each data product is not accounted for. This observation-based dataset is distinct from modeled estimates and therefore has the potential to preserve important information of anthropogenic effects on the water balance.},

abstract = {Surface and atmospheric water balances analysis for Amazon River basin at monthly time scale are performed with an emphasis on the linkages between the Andes and low-lying Amazonia. Analyses are performed using observational and reanalysis data covering five different periods of analysis (depending on length of evapotranspiration data sets) for the entire basin, major subcatchments, and for the Andes and low-lying Amazonia. Results for the entire basin show a state close to balance within tolerance, while the spatial disaggregation produced a less clear picture, presenting major discrepancies between observations and reanalysis data sets. The atmospheric budget exhibits no closure and positive residuals regardless of data set, with the magnitude of residuals for the entire Amazon basin highly dependent on evapotranspiration data source. The imbalance between the two water budgets (14%–16%) is driven by higher values of runoff and by an abrupt change in runoff when changing from dry to wet seasons in the Amazon. We unveil two shortcomings of the available data, namely poor quality in the representation of surface processes by reanalysis, and flaws and scarcity of information in the high Andes that induce uncertainties and errors in both water budgets. The results of the present study highlight the importance of the Andean region for the hydrological integrity of the entire Amazon River basin. Our results confirm the paramount importance of the joint analysis of atmospheric and surface water budgets at the basin level with respect to achieving a complete understanding of the whole hydrological cycle at the continental scale.},

abstract = {This study explores the uncertainties in terrestrial water budget estimation over High Mountain Asia (HMA) using a suite of uncoupled land surface model (LSM) simulations. The uncertainty in the water balance components of precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and terrestrial water storage (TWS) is significantly impacted by the uncertainty in the driving meteorology, with precipitation being the most important boundary condition. Ten gridded precipitation datasets along with a mix of model-, satellite-, and gauge-based products, are evaluated first to assess their suitability for LSM simulations over HMA. The datasets are evaluated by quantifying the systematic and random errors of these products as well as the temporal consistency of their trends. Though the broader spatial patterns of precipitation are generally well captured by the datasets, they differ significantly in their means and trends. In general, precipitation datasets that incorporate information from gauges are found to have higher accuracy with low Root Mean Square Errors and high correlation coefficient values. An ensemble of LSM simulations with selected subset of precipitation products is then used to produce the mean annual fluxes and their uncertainty over HMA in P, ET, and R to be 2.11 ± 0.45, 1.26 ± 0.11, and 0.85 ± 0.36 mm per day, respectively. The mean annual estimates of the surface mass (water) balance components from this model ensemble are comparable to global estimates from prior studies. However, the uncertainty/spread of P, ET, and R is significantly larger than the corresponding estimates from global studies. A comparison of ET, snow cover fraction, and changes in TWS estimates against remote sensing-based references confirms the significant role of the input meteorology in influencing the water budget characterization over HMA and points to the need for improving meteorological inputs.},

abstract = {This chapter provides a guide for parasitologists and fishery biologists to the use of parasites as biological tags for stock identification of marine fish. Parasite tags have certain advantages over other methods of stock identification, but they also have their limitations, so we strongly recommend an interdisciplinary approach in which the results from different methods are compared and used to complement one another. Some biological features to consider in the selection of a good tag parasite are described here, but these should be regarded as guidelines rather than strict criteria. Two different approaches to the use of parasites as biological tags are described, one in which a large number of fish are examined for a small number of parasite taxa and the other in which entire parasite assemblages are analyzed using multivariate statistical methods. Example case studies are given, which are representative of the two approaches. The statistical methods applied to parasite infection data tag studies are described and discussed, with references to studies in which they have been used. Recommendations are given for the collection of hosts and parasites to ensure that parasites are collected in the best possible condition, and methods for the preparation of parasites for examination are described. Parasite groups requiring special attention in their collection and preparation are highlighted, and publications giving identification keys to different taxonomic groups of parasites are provided. There is also a section dealing with the interpretation of results in terms of stock identification. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Mean planetary values are examined and compared, over ocean, with information from recent satellite programs and related estimates, with generally positive agreements, but with some indication of small underestimates for GPCP over the global ocean. Variations during the satellite era in global precipitation are tied to ENSO events, with small increases during El Ninos, and very noticeable decreases after major volcanic eruptions. No overall significant trend is noted in the global precipitation mean value, unlike that for surface temperature and atmospheric water vapor. However, there is a pattern of positive and negative trends across the planet with increases over tropical oceans and decreases over some middle latitude regions. These observed patterns are a result of a combination of inter-decadal variations and the effect of the global warming during the period. The results reviewed here indicate the value of such analyses as GPCP and the possible improvement in the information as the record lengthens and as new, more sophisticated and more accurate observations are included.},

abstract = {We assess the controls of the terrestrial water budget over the Eurasian pan-Arctic drainage region from 2003 to 2009 by combining observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) with reanalysis estimates of net precipitation and observations of river discharge from gauges. Of particular interest are the expansive permafrost regions. Thawing permafrost has been implicated to contribute to the observed discharge increases through the melting of excess ground ice. We show that terrestrial water storage (TWS) over large areas of the Eurasian pan-Arctic region has increased during 2003–2009. However, significant interannual TWS variability is present and most TWS increases occur over nonpermafrost regions in the Ob and Yenisei basins. Over the central Lena basin, which is mostly underlain by permafrost, TWS steadily increased until 2007 but has slightly declined since. By combining GRACE observations of TWS anomalies with discharge and net precipitation, we show that the terrestrial water budget is at least qualitatively closed over the Eurasian Arctic basins. The observed TWS and discharge increases over the study time period were driven by increased atmospheric moisture fluxes. Therefore, we conclude that melting of excess ground ice in permafrost regions did not act as a source to observed changes in discharge. Nonetheless, the signature of significant TWS increases points to ongoing thickening of the active layer in particular over the discontinuous permafrost regions in the central Lena basin.},

abstract = {Thermal infrared (IR) radiances measured near 8 microns contain information about the vertical distribution of water vapor (H 2O), the water isotopologue HDO, and methane (CH 4), key gases in the water and carbon cycles. Previous versions (Version 4 or less) of the TES profile retrieval algorithm used a "spectral-window" approach to minimize uncertainty from interfering species at the expense of reduced vertical resolution and sensitivity. In this manuscript we document changes to the vertical resolution and uncertainties of the TES version 5 retrieval algorithm. In this version (Version 5), joint estimates of H 2O, HDO, CH 4 and nitrous oxide (N 2O) are made using radiances from almost the entire spectral region between 1100 cmg -1 and 1330 cmg -1. The TES retrieval constraints are also modified in order to better use this information. The new H 2O estimates show improved vertical resolution in the lower troposphere and boundary layer, while the new HDO/H 2O estimates can now profile the HDO/H 2O ratio between 925 hPa and 450 hPa in the tropics and during summertime at high latitudes. The new retrievals are now sensitive to methane in the free troposphere between 800 and 150 mb with peak sensitivity near 500 hPa; whereas in previous versions the sensitivity peaked at 200 hPa. However, the upper troposphere methane concentrations are biased high relative to the lower troposphere by approximately 4% on average. This bias is likely related to temperature, calibration, and/or methane spectroscopy errors. This bias can be mitigated by normalizing the CH 4 estimate by the ratio of the N 2O estimate relative to the N 2O prior, under the assumption that the same systematic error affects both the N 2O and CH 4 estimates. We demonstrate that applying this ratio theoretically reduces the CH 4 estimate for non-retrieved parameters that jointly affect both the N 2O and CH 4 estimates. The relative upper troposphere to lower troposphere bias is approximately 2.8% after this bias correction. Quality flags based upon the vertical variability of the methane and N 2O estimates can be used to reduce this bias further. While these new CH 4, HDO/H 2O, and H 2O estimates are consistent with previous TES retrievals in the altitude regions where the sensitivities overlap, future comparisons with independent profile measurement will be required to characterize the biases of these new retrievals and determine if the calculated uncertainties using the new constraints are consistent with actual uncertainties. {\textcopyright}2012 Author(s).},

Monthly global precipitation estimates from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Merged Analy-sis of Precipitation (CMAP) span from 1979 to 1999. Monthly global Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I)-based bulk aerodynamic ocean evaporation estimates span from June 1987 to December 1999. Global terrestrial evapotranspiration rates are estimated over a multidecade period (1975–99) using a global land model simulation forced by bias-corrected reanalysis data. Monthly total precipitable water (TPW) from the NASA Global Water Vapor Project (NVAP) spans from 1988 to 1999. The averaged annual global precipitation (P) and evaporation (E) estimates are out of balance by 5% or 24 000 (metric) gigatons (Gton) of water, which exceeds the uncertainty of global mean annual precipitation (ϳϮ1%). For any given year, the annual flux imbalance can be on the order of 10% (48 000 Gton of water). However, observed global TPW interannual variations suggest a water flux imbalance on the order of 0.01% (48 Gton of water)—a finding consistent with a general circulation model (GCM) simulation. Variations in observationally based global P and E rates show weak monthly and interannual consistency, and depending on the choice of ocean evaporation data, the mean annual cycle of global E Ϫ P can be up to 5 times larger to that of TPW. The global ocean annual evaporation rates have as much as a ϳ1% yr Ϫ1 increase during the period analyzed (1988–99), which is consistent in sign with most transient CO 2 GCM simulations, but at least an order of magnitude larger. The ocean evaporation trends are driven by trends in SSM/I-retrieved near-surface atmospheric humidity and wind speed, and the largest year-to-year changes are coincident with transitions in the SSM/I fleet. In light of (potential) global water cycle changes in GCM projections, the ability to consistently detect or verify these changes in nature rests upon one or more of the following: quantification of global evaporation uncertainty, at least a twofold improvement in consistency between the observationally based global pre-cipitation and evaporation variations, a two order of magnitude rectification between annual variations of E Ϫ P and precipitable water as well as substantial improvements in the consistency of their seasonal cycles, a critical reevaluation of intersatellite calibration for the relevant geophysical quantities used for ocean evaporation estimates, and the continuation of a dedicated calibration in this regard for future satellite transitions.},

abstract = {Hydrological connectivity regulates the structure and function of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems and the provisioning of services that sustain local populations. This connectivity is increasingly being disrupted by the construction of dams, mining, land-cover changes, and global climate change. This review analyzes these drivers of degradation, evaluates their impacts on hydrological connectivity, and identifies policy deficiencies that hinder freshwater ecosystem protection. There are 154 large hydroelectric dams in operation today, and 21 dams under construction. The current trajectory of dam construction will leave only three free-flowing tributaries in the next few decades if all 277 planned dams are completed. Land-cover changes driven by mining, dam and road construction, agriculture and cattle ranching have already affected $\sim$20% of the Basin and up to $\sim$50% of riparian forests in some regions. Global climate change will likely exacerbate these impacts by creating warmer and dryer conditions, with less predictable rainfall and more extreme events (e.g., droughts and floods). The resulting hydrological alterations are rapidly degrading freshwater ecosystems, both independently and via complex feedbacks and synergistic interactions. The ecosystem impacts include biodiversity loss, warmer stream temperatures, stronger and more frequent floodplain fires, and changes to biogeochemical cycles, transport of organic and inorganic materials, and freshwater community structure and function. The impacts also include reductions in water quality, fish yields, and availability of water for navigation, power generation, and human use. This degradation of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems cannot be curbed presently because existing policies are inconsistent across the Basin, ignore cumulative effects, and overlook the hydrological connectivity of freshwater ecosystems. Maintaining the integrity of these freshwater ecosystems requires a basinwide research and policy framework to understand and manage hydrological connectivity across multiple spatial scales and jurisdictional boundaries.},

The Ice Concentration Retrieval from the Analysis of Microwaves (IceCREAM) algorithm is based on an optimal estimation, with a simple radiative transfer model derived from satellite observations at 0% and 100% SIC. Observations at low and high frequencies have different spatial resolutions, and a scheme is developed to benefit from the low errors of the low frequencies and the high spatial resolutions of the high frequencies. This effort is specifically designed for the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) project, equipped with a large deployable antenna to provide a spatial resolution of ∼5 km at 18 and 36 GHz, and ∼15 km at 6 and 10 GHz. The algorithm is tested with Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) observations, for a clear scene over the north polar region, with collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) estimates and the Ocean Sea Ice—Satellite Application Facilities (OSI SAF) operational products. Several algorithm options are tested, and the study case shows that both high spatial resolution and low errors are obtained with the IceCREAM method. It is also tested for the full polar regions, winter and summer, under clear and cloudy conditions. Our method is globally applicable, without fine-tuning or further weather filtering. The systematic use of all channels from 6 to 36 GHz makes it robust to changes in ice surface conditions and to weather interactions.</p>},

abstract = {Recently developed methodologies such as climate reanalysis make it possible to create a historical record of climate systems. This paper proposes a methodology called Hydrological Retrospective (HR), which essentially simulates large rainfall datasets, using this as input into hydrological models to develop a record of past hydrology, making it possible to analyze past floods and droughts. We developed a methodology for the Amazon basin, where studies have shown an increase in the intensity and frequency of hydrological extreme events in recent decades. We used eight large precipitation datasets (more than 30 years) as input for a large scale hydrological and hydrodynamic model (MGB-IPH). HR products were then validated against several in situ discharge gauges controlling the main Amazon sub-basins, focusing on maximum and minimum events. For the most accurate HR, based on performance metrics, we performed a forecast skill of HR to detect floods and droughts, comparing the results with in-situ observations. A statistical temporal series trend was performed for intensity of seasonal floods and droughts in the entire Amazon basin. Results indicate that HR could represent most past extreme events well, compared with in-situ observed data, and was consistent with many events reported in literature. Because of their flow duration, some minor regional events were not reported in literature but were captured by HR. To represent past regional hydrology and seasonal hydrological extreme events, we believe it is feasible to use some large precipitation datasets such as i) climate reanalysis, which is mainly based on a land surface component, and ii) datasets based on merged products. A significant upward trend in intensity was seen in maximum annual discharge (related to floods) in western and northwestern regions and for minimum annual discharge (related to droughts) in south and central-south regions of the Amazon basin. Because of the global coverage of rainfall datasets, this methodology can be transferred to other regions for better estimation of future hydrological behavior and its impact on society.},

abstract = {This paper provides an updated review of the most relevant scientific literature related to the hydroclimate of the Andes. The Andes, the longest cordillera in the world, faces major challenges regarding climate variability and climate change, which impose several threats to sustainable development, including water supply and the sustainability of ecosystem services. This review focuses on hydroclimate variability of the Andes at a sub-continental scale. The annual water cycle and long-term water balance along the Andes are addressed first, followed by the examination of the effects of orography on convective and frontal precipitation through the study of precipitation gradients in the tropical, subtropical and extratropical Andes. In addition, a review is presented of the current scientific literature on the climate variability in the Andes at different timescales. Finally, open research questions are presented in the last section of this article.},

abstract = {The French research community in the Mediterranean Sea modeling and the French operational ocean forecasting center Mercator Oc{\'{e}}an have gathered their skill and expertise in physical oceanography, ocean modeling, atmospheric forcings and data assimilation to carry out a MEDiterranean sea ReanalYsiS (MEDRYS) at high resolution for the period 1992–2013. The ocean model used is NEMOMED12, a Mediterranean configuration of NEMO with a 1∕12° ( ∼ 7 km) horizontal resolution and 75 vertical z levels with partial steps. At the surface, it is forced by a new atmospheric-forcing data set (ALDERA), coming from a dynamical downscaling of the ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis by the regional climate model ALADIN-Climate with a 12 km horizontal and 3 h temporal resolutions. This configuration is used to carry a 34-year hindcast simulation over the period 1979–2013 (NM12-FREE), which is the initial state of the reanalysis in October 1992. MEDRYS uses the existing Mercator Oc{\'{e}}an data assimilation system SAM2 that is based on a reduced-order Kalman filter with a three-dimensional (3-D) multivariate modal decomposition of the forecast error. Altimeter data, satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and temperature and salinity vertical profiles are jointly assimilated. This paper describes the configuration we used to perform MEDRYS. We then validate the skills of the data assimilation system. It is shown that the data assimilation restores a good average temperature and salinity at intermediate layers compared to the hindcast. No particular biases are identified in the bottom layers. However, the reanalysis shows slight positive biases of 0.02 psu and 0.15 °C above 150 m depth. In the validation stage, it is also shown that the assimilation allows one to better reproduce water, heat and salt transports through the Strait of Gibraltar. Finally, the ability of the reanalysis to represent the sea surface high-frequency variability is shown.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporally continuous global river discharge estimates across the full spectrum of stream orders are vital to a range of hydrologic applications, yet they remain poorly constrained. Here we present a carefully designed modeling effort (Variable Infiltration Capacity land surface model and Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge river routing model) to estimate global river discharge at very high resolutions. The precipitation forcing is from a recently published 0.1° global product that optimally merged gauge-, reanalysis-, and satellite-based data. To constrain runoff simulations, we use a set of machine learning-derived, global runoff characteristics maps (i.e., runoff at various exceedance probability percentiles) for grid-by-grid model calibration and bias correction. To support spaceborne discharge studies, the river flowlines are defined at their true geometry and location as much as possible—approximately 2.94 million vector flowlines (median length 6.8 km) and unit catchments are derived from a high-accuracy global digital elevation model at 3-arcsec resolution ($\sim$90 m), which serves as the underlying hydrography for river routing. Our 35-year daily and monthly model simulations are evaluated against over 14,000 gauges globally. Among them, 35% (64%) have a percentage bias within ±20% (±50%), and 29% (62%) have a monthly Kling-Gupta Efficiency ≥0.6 (0.2), showing data robustness at the scale the model is assessed. This reconstructed discharge record can be used as a priori information for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission's discharge product, thus named “Global Reach-level A priori Discharge Estimates for Surface Water and Ocean Topography”. It can also be used in other hydrologic applications requiring spatially explicit estimates of global river flows.},

abstract = {Balancing global moisture budgets is a difficult task that is even more challenging at regional scales. At- mospheric water budget components are investigated within five tropical (158S–158N) ocean regions, in- cluding the Indian Ocean, three Pacific regions, and one Atlantic region, to determine how well data products balance these budgets. Initially, a selection of independent observations and a reanalysis product are eval- uated to determine overall closure, between 1998 and 2007. Satellite-based observations from SeaFlux evaporation and Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation, together with Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data products, were chosen. Freshwater flux (evaporation minus precipitation) observations and reanalysis atmospheric moisture divergence regional averages are assessed for closure. Moisture budgets show the best closure over the Indian Ocean with a correlation of 89% and an overall imbalance of23.0% of the anomalies. Of the five regions, the western Pacific Ocean region produces the worst atmospheric moisture budget closure of 221.1%, despite a high correlation of 93%. Average closure over the five regions is within 8.1%, and anomalies are correlated at 83%. ERA-Interim and Modern- Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) evaporation rates are 29 and 19mmmonth21 greater than SeaFlux, respectively. To diagnose the differences, wind speed and humidity gradients of the three products are compared utilizing the bulk formula for evaporation. SeaFlux wind speeds are higher, but sea–air humidity gradients are lower. Higher humidity gradients in the reanalyses are due to much dryer near-surface air in ERA-Interim, and the same to a lesser degree inMERRA. These differences counteract each other somewhat, but overall humidity biases exceed wind biases. This is consistent with buoy observations. 1.},

abstract = {A terrestrial ecosystem model (integrated biosphere simulator (IBIS)) and a hydrological routing algorithm (HYDRA) are used in conjunction with long time series climate data to simulate the river discharge and flooded area of the Amazon/Tocantins River basin over the last 60 years. Evaluating the results of this modeling exercise over the entire basin yields three major results: (1) Observations at 121 stations throughout the basin show that discharge is well simulated for most tributaries originating in Brazil. However, the discharge is consistently underestimated, by greater than 20%, for tributaries draining regions outside of Brazil and the main stem of the Amazon. The discharge underestimation is most likely a result of underestimated precipitation in the data set used as model input. (2) A new flooding algorithm within HYDRA captures the magnitude and timing of the river height and flooded area in relatively good agreement with observations, particularly downstream of the confluence of the Negro and Solimoes Rivers. (3) Climatic variability strongly impacts the hydrology of the basin. Specifically, we find that short (similar to3-4 years) and long (similar to28 years) modes of precipitation variability drive spatial and temporal variability in river discharge and flooded area throughout the Amazon/Tocantins River basins.},

abstract = {The accurate specification of observing and/or modeling error statistics presents a remaining challenge to the successful implementation of many land data assimilation systems. Recent work has developed adaptive filtering approaches that address this issue. However, such approaches possess a number of known weaknesses, including a required assumption of serially uncorrelated error in assimilated observations. Recent validation results for remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals call this assumption into question. Here we propose and test an alternative system for tuning a soil moisture data assimilation system, which is robust to the presence of autocorrelated observing error. The approach is based on the application of a triple collocation approach to estimate the error variance of remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals. Using this estimate, the variance of assumed modeling perturbations is tuned until normalized filtering innovations have a temporal variance of one. Real data results over three highly instrumented watershed sites in the United States demonstrate that this approach is superior to a classical tuning strategy based on removing the serial autocorrelation in Kalman filtering innovations and nearly as accurate as a calibrated Colored Kalman filter in which autocorrelated observing errors are treated optimally.},

abstract = {The relationship between the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) and the seasonal cycle of the intraseasonal rainfall variability in the Amazon Basin (AB) are analysed using band-pass-filtered gauge-based gridded rainfall data for the 1980–2009 period. Intraseasonal events (IE) have been defined and selected based on extreme values of the first principal component (PC1) time series, which comes from the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis applied to the filtered rainfall data over the AB. A total of 132 IEs were identified with an average of approximately five events per year. About 25% of the total IEs in the Amazon region are not restricted to the eastwards propagating equatorially confined MJO and other mechanisms (e.g., through Rossby wave trains in the Southern Hemisphere) might play an important role. In addition, we find that the incomplete IEs (events that do not evolve through a complete life cycle) are associated with suppressed rainfall conditions over tropical South America. The development of the IEs over the AB, when compared with the different phases of the MJO index, shows a coherent relationship, where convective-based indices are able to better account their evolution. On a global scale, the upper-tropospheric patterns and the rainfall composites based on the PC1 time series show that the MJO is one of the main atmospheric modulator mechanisms of the intraseasonal rainfall variability over the Amazon region throughout the annual cycle. It is found that the intraseasonal variability is particularly important during the austral winter, when the percentage contribution with respect to the mean daily seasonal precipitation over some Amazon regions can reach 50%.},

Conducted under the auspices of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Rome, Italy, CIRCE was designed to predict and to quantify the physical impacts of climate change in the Mediterranean, and to assess the most influential consequences for the region's population. This volume incorporates the first two parts of the report, reviewing current knowledge of observed climate variability and trends in the Mediterranean, and including descriptions of available temperature and precipitation station and gridded data sets. Part 1 deals with analyses of the physical aspects of climate change in the Mediterranean, assessing possible changes under greenhouse concentration scenarios, estimating uncertainties, detecting and attributing past and present changes, understanding mechanisms and evaluating their relevance in the problem of climate change. Part 2 offers an overview of water resources, and reviews the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle of the region. Volume 2, subtitled Agriculture, Forests and Ecosystem Services and People comprises Parts 3 and 4 of the report. These focus respectively on ecosystem services and socio-economic impacts of climate change in the Mediterranean region. Volume 3 presents case studies performed in CIRCE, representing urban, rural and coastal environments and drawn from the north and the south of the Mediterranean shore. Regional Assessment of Climate Change in the Mediterranean represents a research initiative of unprecedented size and scope. Each volume is carefully constructed to stand alone, offering a wealth of information and insight. Beyond its own significant value, the report is expected to contribute to a rapidly expanding body of research and analysis on the topic.

abstract = {For half a century, the process of economic integration of the Amazon has been based on intensive use of renewable and nonrenewable natural resources, which has brought significant basin-wide environmental alterations. The rural development in the Amazonia pushed the agricultural frontier swiftly, resulting in widespread land-cover change, but agriculture in the Amazon has been of low productivity and unsustainable. The loss of biodiversity and continued deforestation will lead to high risks of irreversible change of its tropical forests. It has been established by modeling studies that the Amazon may have two "tipping points," namely, temperature increase of 4 ° C or deforestation exceeding 40% of the forest area. If transgressed, large-scale "savannization" of mostly southern and eastern Amazon may take place. The region has warmed about 1 ° C over the last 60 y, and total deforestation is reaching 20% of the forested area. The recent significant reductions in deforestation-80% reduction in the Brazilian Amazon in the last decade-opens up opportunities for a novel sustainable development paradigm for the future of the Amazon. We argue for a new development paradigm-away from only attempting to reconcile maximizing conservation versus intensification of traditional agriculture and expansion of hydropower capacity-in which we research, develop, and scale a high-tech innovation approach that sees the Amazon as a global public good of biological assets that can enable the creation of innovative high-value products, services, and platforms through combining advanced digital, biological, and material technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in progress.},

abstract = {Accurate and timely surface precipitation measurements are crucial for water resources management, agriculture, weather prediction, climate research, as well as ground validation of satellite-based precipitation estimates. However, the majority of the land surface of the earth lacks such data, and in many parts of the world the density of surface precipitation gauging networks is even rapidly declining. This development can potentially be counteracted by using received signal level data from the enormous number of microwave links used worldwide in commercial cellular communication networks. Along such links, radio signals propagate from a transmitting antenna at one base station to a receiving antenna at another base station. Rain-induced attenuation and, subsequently, path-averaged rainfall intensity can be retrieved from the signal's attenuation between transmitter and receiver. Here, we show how one such a network can be used to retrieve the space-time dynamics of rainfall for an entire country (The Netherlands, ∼35,500 km2), based on an unprecedented number of links (∼2,400) and a rainfall retrieval algorithm that can be applied in real time. This demonstrates the potential of such networks for real-time rainfall monitoring, in particular in those parts of the world where networks of dedicated ground-based rainfall sensors are often virtually absent.},

Many maps of open water and wetlands have been developed based on three main methods: (i) compiling national and regional wetland surveys, (ii) identifying inundated areas via satellite imagery and (iii) delineating wetlands as shallow water table areas based on groundwater modeling. However, the resulting global wetland extents vary from 3 % to 21 % of the land surface area because of inconsistencies in wetland definitions and limitations in observation or modeling systems. To reconcile these differences, we propose composite wetland (CW) maps, combining two classes of wetlands: (1) regularly flooded wetlands (RFWs) obtained by overlapping selected open-water and inundation datasets; and (2) groundwater-driven wetlands (GDWs) derived from groundwater modeling (either direct or simplified using several variants of the topographic index). Wetlands are statically defined as areas with persistent near-saturated soil surfaces because of regular flooding or shallow groundwater, disregarding most human alterations (potential wetlands). Seven CW maps were generated at 15 arcsec resolution (ca. 500 m at the Equator) using geographic information system (GIS) tools and by combining one RFW and different GDW maps. To validate this approach, these CW maps were compared with existing wetland datasets at the global and regional scales. The spatial patterns were decently captured, but the wetland extents were difficult to assess compared to the dispersion of the validation datasets. Compared with the only regional dataset encompassing both GDWs and RFWs, over France, the CW maps performed well and better than all other considered global wetland datasets. Two CW maps, showing the best overall match with the available evaluation datasets, were eventually selected. These maps provided global wetland extents of 27.5 and 29 million km2, i.e., 21.1 % and 21.6 % of the global land area, which are among the highest values in the literature and are in line with recent estimates also recognizing the contribution of GDWs. This wetland class covers 15 % of the global land area compared with 9.7 % for RFW (with an overlap of ca. 3.4 %), including wetlands under canopy and/or cloud cover, leading to high wetland densities in the tropics and small scattered wetlands that cover less than 5 % of land but are highly important for hydrological and ecological functioning in temperate to arid areas. By distinguishing the RFWs and GDWs based globally on uniform principles, the proposed dataset might be useful for large-scale land surface modeling (hydrological, ecological and biogeochemical modeling) and environmental planning. The dataset consisting of the two selected CW maps and the contributing GDW and RFW maps is available from PANGAEA at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.892657 (Tootchi et al., 2018).]]></p>},

abstract = {Due to progressive erosion of the new Urucurituba Channel, the Amazon River has recently captured almost all discharge from the lower Araguari River (Amap{\'{a}}-AP, Brazil), which previously flowed directly to the Atlantic Ocean. These recent geomorphological changes have caused strong impacts on the landscape and hydrodynamic patterns near the Araguari River mouth, especially the alteration of the riverine drainage system and its water quality. Landsat images were used to assess the estuarine landscape morphodynamic, particularly the expansion of the Urucurituba Channel, 80 km from the Araguari River mouth, chronicling its connection to the Amazon River. The results suggest that the Urucurituba developed by headward migration across the Amazon delta; this is perhaps the first observation of estuarine distributary network development by headward channel erosion. The rate of Urucurituba Channel width increase has been ≈ 5 m/month since 2011, increasing drainage capacity of the channel. We also collected in situ hydrodynamic measurements and analyzed 17 water quality parameters. Having 2011 as baseline, the flowrate of Araguari River has been diverted by up to 98% through Urucurituba Channel, with substantial changes in net discharge recorded at 3 monitoring stations. Statistically significant differences in water quality (p < 0.05) were observed between 2011 and 2015, associated with the change in the flow pattern. Estuarine salinity and solids concentrations have increased. Overall, we demonstrate changes in landscape, hydrodynamics and water quality of the lower Araguari River.},

abstract = {In the present study, we focus on the assimilation of satellite observations for Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) in a hydrological model. The satellite data are produced in the framework of the EUMETSAT project H-SAF and are based on measurements with the Advanced radar Scatterometer (ASCAT), embarked on the Meteorological Operational satellites (MetOp). The product generated with these measurements has a horizontal resolution of 25km and represents the upper few centimeters of soil. Our approach is based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter technique (EnKF), where observation and model uncertainties are taken into account, implemented in a conceptual hydrological model. The analysis is carried out in the Demer catchment of the Scheldt River Basin in Belgium, for the period from June 2013–May 2016. In this context, two methodological advances are being proposed. First, the generation of stochastic terms, necessary for the EnKF, of bounded variables like SSM is addressed with the aid of specially-designed probability distributions, so that the bounds are never exceeded. Second, bias due to the assimilation procedure itself is removed using a post-processing technique. Subsequently, the impact of SSM assimilation on the simulated streamflow is estimated using a series of statistical measures based on the ensemble average. The differences from the control simulation are then assessed using a two-dimensional bootstrap sampling on the ensemble generated by the assimilation procedure. Our analysis shows that data assimilation combined with bias correction can improve the streamflow estimations or, at a minimum, produce results statistically indistinguishable from the control run of the hydrological model.},

abstract = {Long-term gridded precipitation products are crucial for several applications in hydrology, agriculture and climate sciences. Currently available precipitation products suffer from space and time inconsistency due to the non-uniform density of ground networks and the difficulties in merging multiple satellite sensors. The recent "bottom-up" approach that exploits satellite soil moisture observations for estimating rainfall through the SM2RAIN (Soil Moisture to Rain) algorithm is suited to build a consistent rainfall data record as a single polar orbiting satellite sensor is used. Here we exploit the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on board three Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites, launched in 2006, 2012, and 2018, as part of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Polar System programme. The continuity of the scatterometer sensor is ensured until the mid-2040s through the MetOp Second Generation Programme. Therefore, by applying the SM2RAIN algorithm to ASCAT soil moisture observations, a long-term rainfall data record will be obtained, starting in 2007 and lasting until the mid-2040s. The paper describes the recent improvements in data pre-processing, SM2RAIN algorithm formulation, and data post-processing for obtaining the SM2RAIN-ASCAT quasi-global (only over land) daily rainfall data record at a 12.5 km spatial sampling from 2007 to 2018. The quality of the SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record is assessed on a regional scale through comparison with high-quality ground networks in Europe, the United States, India, and Australia. Moreover, an assessment on a global scale is provided by using the triple-collocation (TC) technique allowing us also to compare these data with the latest, fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5), the Early Run version of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), and the gauge-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) products. Results show that the SM2RAIN-ASCAT rainfall data record performs relatively well at both a regional and global scale, mainly in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) when compared to other products. Specifically, the SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record provides performance better than IMERG and GPCC in data-scarce regions of the world, such as Africa and South America. In these areas, we expect larger benefits in using SM2RAIN-ASCAT for hydrological and agricultural applications. The limitations of the SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record consist of the underestimation of peak rainfall events and the presence of spurious rainfall events due to high-frequency soil moisture fluctuations that might be corrected in the future with more advanced bias correction techniques. The SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3405563 (Brocca et al., 2019) (recently extended to the end of August 2019).},

abstract = {Human activities, such as dam construction, significantly altered the flow regimes in the Mekong River, particularly after the completion of two large dams, namely Xiaowan and Nuozhadu in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Streamflow data from 1960 to 2014 obtained from five stations located along the Mekong mainstream are divided into three periods, i.e., the pre-impact period (1960–1991), the transition period (1992–2009), and the post-impact period (2010–2014). The flow regimes were investigated using eco-flow metrics and indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA). The results show that the construction and initial filling of the upstream dams reduced the annual streamflow in the upstream Chiang Saen gauging station, whereas no clear effect was observed in the downstream Stung Treng station. The operation of dams reduces the streamflow in wet seasons and increases the streamflow in dry seasons, resulting in a unique seasonal variation in the streamflow based on eco-flow metrics in the Chiang Saen gauging station, observed from 2010 to 2014. In addition, the maximum flow values decreased significantly in the Chiang Saen gauging station during the year corresponding to the completion of the upstream dams. The construction and operation of dams clearly have significant impacts on low pulse duration. It is observed that climate change dictated the changes in the annual streamflow during the transition period 1992–2009 (82.28%), whereas human activities contributed more in the post-impact period 2010–2014 (61.88%). The results of this study could provide a reference for reservoir operation in the upstream regions considering both ecological and economic benefits of such operations, as well as maximize the interests of stakeholders in this region.},

abstract = {Amazon tropical forests and the semiarid Northeast Brazil (NEB) region have registered very severe droughts during the last two decades, with a frequency that may have exceeded natural climate variability. Severe droughts impact the physiological response of Amazon forests, decreasing the availability to absorb atmospheric CO2, as well as biodiversity and increasing risk of fires. Droughts on this region also affect population by isolating them due to anomalous low river levels. Impacts of droughts over NEB region are related to water and energy security and subsistence agriculture. Most drought episodes over Amazonia and NEB are associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o (EN) events, anomalous warming over the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), and even an overlapping among them. However, not all the dry episodes showed a large-scale pattern linked to a canonical EN event or warm TNA episodes. For instance, dry episodes linked to EN events present distinct spatial patterns of precipitation anomalies depending on EN type (Central-Pacific vs. Eastern-Pacific EN), and NEB region experienced a severe drought in 2012 that is not attributed to EN or warm TNA events. Even in the case of the strong EN in 2015/16, some regional impacts have not been explained by EN contribution. This paper discusses the effects of CP and EP EN events, and the role of warm TNA events on tropical Walker and Hadley circulation leading to drought over Amazonia and NEB regions.},

The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, which provides the new generation of rainfall estimates, is now considered a global successor to TRMM. The usefulness of GPM data in hydrological applications, however, has not yet been evaluated over the Andean and Amazonian regions. This study uses GPM data provided by the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals (IMERG) (product/final run) as input to a distributed hydrological model for the Amazon Basin of Peru and Ecuador for a 16-month period (from March 2014 to June 2015) when all datasets are available. TRMM products (TMPA V7 and TMPA RT datasets) and a gridded precipitation dataset processed from observed rainfall are used for comparison. The results indicate that precipitation data derived from GPM-IMERG correspond more closely to TMPA V7 than TMPA RT datasets, but both GPM-IMERG and TMPA V7 precipitation data tend to overestimate, compared to observed rainfall (by 11.1 and 15.7 %, respectively). In general, GPM-IMERG, TMPA V7 and TMPA RT correlate with observed rainfall, with a similar number of rain events correctly detected (∼ 20 %). Statistical analysis of modeled streamflows indicates that GPM-IMERG is as useful as TMPA V7 or TMPA RT datasets in southern regions (Ucayali Basin). GPM-IMERG, TMPA V7 and TMPA RT do not properly simulate streamflows in northern regions (Mara{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n and Napo basins), probably because of the lack of adequate rainfall estimates in northern Peru and the Ecuadorian Amazon.},

Global fields of W from the special sensor microwave imager (SSMI) were compared with those from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model. They agree over most ocean areas; both data sets capture the two annual cycles examined and the interannual anomalies during an El Nifio-Southern Oscillation episode. However, they show significant differences in the dry air masses over the eastern tropical-subtropical oceans, particularly in the southern hemisphere. In these regions, comparisons with radiosonde data indicate that overestimation by the ECMWF model accounts for a large part of the differences. As a check on the W differences, surface level specific humidity O derived from W, using a statistical relation, were compared with O from the ECMWF model. The differences in O were found to be consistent with the differences in W, and indirectly validating the Q-W relation. In both W and Q, SSMI was able to discern clearly the equatorial extension of the tongues of dry air in the eastern tropical ocean, while both ECMWF and climatological fields have reduced spatial gradients and weaker intensity. One of the reasons for the ECMWF moisture overestimation is suggested to the poor resolution of Tiros-N operational vertical sounder data which were assimilated into the ECMWF model.},

abstract = {Land surface models combined with river routing models are widely used to study the continental part of the water cycle. They give global estimates of water flows and storages, but they are not without non-negligible uncertainties , among which inexact input parameters play a significant part. The incoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, with a launch scheduled for 2021 and with a required lifetime of at least 3 years, will be dedicated to the measuring of water surface elevations, widths and surface slopes of rivers wider than 100 m, at a global scale. SWOT will provide a significant number of new observations for river hydrology and maybe combined, through data assimilation, with global-scale models in order to correct their input parameters and reduce their associated uncertainty. Comparing simulated water depths with measured water surface elevations remains however a challenge and can introduce within the system large bias. A promising alternative for assimilating water surface elevations consists of assimilating water surface elevation anomalies which do not depend on a reference surface. The objective of this study is to present a data assimilation platform based on the asyn-chronous ensemble Kalman filter (AEnKF) that can assimilate synthetic SWOT observations of water depths and water elevation anomalies to correct the input parameters of a large-scale hydrologic model over a 21 d time window. The study is applied to the ISBA-CTRIP model over the Amazon basin and focuses on correcting the spatial distribution of the river Manning coefficients. The data assimilation algorithm , tested through a set of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs), is able to retrieve the true value of the Manning coefficients within one assimilation cycle much of the time (basin-averaged Manning coefficient root mean square error, RMSEn, is reduced from 33 % to [1 %-10 %] after one assimilation cycle) and shows promising perspectives with assimilating water anomalies (basin-averaged Manning coefficient RMSEn is reduced from 33 % to [1 %-2 %] when assimilating water surface elevation anomalies over 1 year), which allows us to overcome the issue of unknown bathymetry.},

abstract = {Closing the terrestrial water budget is necessary to providing consistent estimates of budget components for understanding water resources and changes over time. Given the lack of in-situ observations of budget components at anything but local scale, merging information from multiple data sources (e.g. in-situ observation, satellite remote sensing, land surface model and reanalysis) through data assimilation techniques that optimize the estimation of fluxes is a promising approach. In this study, a systematic method is developed to optimally combine multiple available data sources for precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R) and the total water storage change (TWSC) at 0.5&deg; spatial resolution globally and to obtain water budget closure (i.e. to enforce P&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;ET&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;R&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;TWSC&thinsp;=&thinsp;0) through a Constrained Kalman Filter (CKF) data assimilation technique. The resulting long-term (1984&ndash;2010), monthly, 0.5&deg; resolution global terrestrial water cycle Climate Data Record (CDR) dataset is developed under the auspices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) program. This dataset serves to bridge the gap between sparsely gauged regions and the regions with sufficient in-situ observations in investigating the temporal and spatial variability in the terrestrial hydrology at multiple scales. The CDR created in this study is validated against in-situ measurements like river discharge from the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and ET from FLUXNET. The dataset is shown to be reliable and can serve the scientific community in understanding historical climate variability in water cycle fluxes and stores, benchmarking the current climate, and validating models.},

abstract = {Accurate snow depth observations are critical to assess water resources. More than a billion people rely on water from snow, most of which originates in the Northern Hemisphere mountain ranges. Yet, remote sensing observations of mountain snow depth are still lacking at the large scale. Here, we show the ability of Sentinel-1 to map snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere mountains at 1 km² resolution using an empirical change detection approach. An evaluation with measurements from $\sim$4000 sites and reanalysis data demonstrates that the Sentinel-1 retrievals capture the spatial variability between and within mountain ranges, as well as their inter-annual differences. This is showcased with the contrasting snow depths between 2017 and 2018 in the US Sierra Nevada and European Alps. With Sentinel-1 continuity ensured until 2030 and likely beyond, these findings lay a foundation for quantifying the long-term vulnerability of mountain snow-water resources to climate change. Remote sensing observations of mountain snow depth are still lacking for the Northern Hemisphere mountains. Here authors use Sentinel-1 satellite radar measurements to assess the snow depth in mountainous areas at 1 km² resolution and show that the Sentinel-1 retrievals capture the spatial variability between and within mountain ranges, as well as their inter-annual differences.},

abstract = {We introduce a set of global high-resolution (0.058) precipitation (P) climatologies corrected for bias using streamflow (Q) observations from 9372 stations worldwide. For each station, we inferred the ‘‘true'' long-term P using a Budyko curve, which is an empirical equation relating long-term P, Q, and potential evaporation. We subsequently calculated long-term bias correction factors for three state-of-the-art P climatologies [the ‘‘WorldClim version 2'' database (WorldClim V2); Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas, version 1.2 (CHELSA V1.2); and Climate Hazards Group Precipitation Climatology, version 1 (CHPclim V1)], after which we used random-forest regression to produce global gap-free bias correction maps for the P climatologies. Monthly climatological bias correction factors were calculated by disaggregating the long-term bias correction factors on the basis of gauge catch efficiencies. We found that all three climatologies systematically underestimate P over parts of all major mountain ranges globally, despite the explicit consideration of orography in the production of each climatology. In addition, all climatologies underestimate P at latitudes .608N, likely because of gauge undercatch. Exceptionally high long-term correction factors (.1.5) were obtained for all three P climatologies in Alaska, High Mountain Asia, and Chile—regions characterized by marked elevation gradients, sparse gauge networks, and significant snowfall. Using the bias-corrected WorldClim V2, we demonstrated that other widely used P datasets (GPCC V2015, GPCP V2.3, and MERRA-2) severely underestimate P over Chile, the Himalayas, and along the Pacific coast of North America. Mean P for the global land surface based on the bias-corrected WorldClim V2 is 862 mm yr21 (a 9.4% increase over the original WorldClim V2). The annual and monthly bias-corrected P climatologies have been released as the Precipitation Bias Correction (PBCOR) dataset, which is available online (http://www.gloh2o.org/pbcor/).},

abstract = {The spatio-temporal variations of the water budget components in the Amazon region are investigated by using a combination of hydrometeorological observations and moisture fluxes derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses, for the period 1970-1999. The key new finding of this study identifies the major differences in the water balance characteristics and variability between the northern and southern parts of the basin. Our results show that there is a seasonality and interannual variability of the water balance that varies across the basin. At interannual time scales, anomalies in the water balance components in the northern Amazon region show relatively stronger links with tropical Pacific interannual variability. Over the entire region, precipitation exceeds evaporation and the basin acts as a sink of moisture (P > E). However, on some occasions the basin can act as a source for moisture (P < E) under extreme conditions, such as those related to deficient rainfall in northern Amazonia during the strong El Ni{\~{n}}o of 1983. Our estimates of the Amazon region's water balance do not show a closure of the budget, with an average imbalance of almost 50%, suggesting that some of the moisture that converges in the Amazon region is not accounted for. The imbalance is larger over the southern Amazon region than over the northern region, and it also exhibits interannual variability. Large uncertainties are detected in the evaporation and moisture-convergence fields derived from the reanalyses, and in the case of evaporation it can be as large as 10-20% when compared with the few field observations across the basin. Observed precipitation fields derived from station data and from grid-box products also show some discrepancies due to sampling problems and interpolation techniques. The streamflow observed at the mouth of the river is obtained after corrections on the series observed taken at a gauging site almost 200 km inland. However, variability in the evaporation, moisture convergence, and observed rainfall and runoff matches quite well. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Evapotranspiration is integral to studies of the Earth system, yet it is difficult to measure on regional scales. One estimation technique is a terrestrial water budget, i.e., total precipitation minus the sum of evapotranspiration and net runoff equals the change in water storage. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite gravity observations are now enabling closure of this equation by providing the terrestrial water storage change. Equations are presented here for estimating evapotranspiration using observation based information, taking into account the unique nature of GRACE observations. GRACE water storage changes are first substantiated by comparing with results from a land surface model and a combined atmospheric-terrestrial water budget approach. Evapotranspiration is then estimated for 14 time periods over the Mississippi River basin and compared with output from three modeling systems. The GRACE estimates generally lay in the middle of the models and may. provide skill in evaluating modeled evapotranspiration. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Many of the scientific and societal challenges in understanding and preparing for global environmental change rest upon our ability to understand and predict the water cycle change at large river basin, continent, and global scales. However, current large-scale land models (as a component of Earth System Models, or ESMs) do not yet reflect the best hydrologic process understanding or utilize the large amount of hydrologic observations for model testing. This paper discusses the opportunities and key challenges to improve hydrologic process representations and benchmarking in ESM land models, suggesting that (1) land model development can benefit from recent advances in hydrology, both through incorporating key processes (e.g., groundwater-surface water interactions) and new approaches to describe multiscale spatial variability and hydrologic connectivity; (2) accelerating model advances requires comprehensive hydrologic benchmarking in order to systematically evaluate competing alternatives, understand model weaknesses, and prioritize model development needs, and (3) stronger collaboration is needed between the hydrology and ESM modeling communities, both through greater engagement of hydrologists in ESM land model development, and through rigorous evaluation of ESM hydrology performance in research watersheds or Critical Zone Observatories. Such coordinated efforts in advancing hydrology in ESMs have the potential to substantially impact energy, carbon, and nutrient cycle prediction capabilities through the fundamental role hydrologic processes play in regulating these cycles.},

abstract = {A multispectral image is a three-order tensor since it is a three-dimensional matrix, i.e., one spectral dimension and two spatial position dimensions. Multispectral image compression can be achieved by means of the advantages of tensor decomposition (TD), such as Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (NTD). Unfortunately, the TD suffers from high calculation complexity and cannot be used in the on-board low-complexity case (e.g., multispectral cameras) that the hardware resources and power are limited. Here, we propose a low-complexity compression approach for multispectral images based on convolution neural networks (CNNs) with NTD. We construct a new spectral transform using CNNs, where the CNNs are able to transform the three-dimension spectraltensor from large-scale to a small-scale version. The NTD resources only allocate the small-scale three-dimension tensor to improve calculation efficiency. We obtain the optimized small-scale spectral tensor by the minimization of original and reconstructed three-dimension spectral tensor in self-learning CNNs. Then, the NTD is applied to the optimized three-dimension spectral tensor in the DCT domain to obtain the high compression performance. We experimentally confirmed the proposed method on multispectral images. Compared to the case that the new spectral tensor transform with CNNs is not applied to the original three-dimension spectral tensor at the same compression bit-rates, the reconstructed image quality could be improved. Compared with the full NTD-based method, the computation efficiency was obviously improved with only a small sacrifices of PSNR without affecting the quality of images.},

abstract = {The flows of energy and water from ocean to land are examined in the context of the land energy and water budgets, for land as a whole and for continents. Most atmospheric reanalyses have large errors of up to 15 W m 22 in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy imbalance, and none include volcanic eruptions. The flow of energy from ocean to land is more reliable as it relies on analyzed wind, temperature, and moisture fields. It is examined for transports of the total, latent energy (LE), and dry static energy (DSE) to land as a whole and as zonal means. The net convergence of energy onto land is balanced by the loss of energy at TOA, measured by Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), and again there are notable discrepancies. Only the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-I) is stable and plausible. Strong compensation between variations in LE and DSE transports onto land means that their sum is more stable over time, and the net transport of energy onto land is largely that associated with the hydrological cycle (LE). A more detailed examination is given of the energy and water budgets for Eurasia, North and South America, Australia, and Africa, making use of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data for water storage on land and data on river discharge into the ocean. With ERA-I, the new land estimates for both water and energy are closer to achieving balances than in previous studies. As well as the annual means, the mean annual cycles are ex-amined in detail along with uncertainty sampling estimates, but the main test used here is that of closure.},

abstract = {This paper presents a description, sensitivity analyses, sample results, validation, and the recent progress done on the development of a new satellite rainfall estimation technique in the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The technique, called the auto-estimator, runs in real time for applications to flash flood forecasting, numerical modeling, operational hydrology. The auto-estimator uses the Geoestationary Operational Environmental Satellite-8 and -9 in the infrared (IR) 10.7-$\mu$m band to compute real-time precipitation amounts based on a power-law regression algorithm. This regression is derived from a statistical analysis between surface radar-derived instantaneous rainfall estimates and satellite-derived IR cloudtop temperatures collocated in time and space. The rainfall rate estimates are adjusted for different moisture regimes using the most recent fields of precipitable water and relative humidity generated by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Eta Model. In addition, a mask is computed to restrict rain to regions satisfying two criteria: (a) the growth rate of the cloud as a function of the temperature change of the cloud tops in two consecutive IR images must be positive, and (b) the spatial gradients of the cloud-top temperature field must show distinct and isolated cold cores in the cloud-top surface. Both the growth rate and the gradient corrections are useful for locating heavy precipitation cores. The auto-estimator has been used experimentally for almost 3 yr to provide real-time instantaneous rainfall rate estimates, average hourly estimates, and 3-, 6-, and 24-h accumulations over the conterminous 48 United States and nearby ocean areas. The NOAA/NESDIS Satellite Analyses Branch (SAB) has examined the accuracy of the rainfall estimates daily for a variety of storm systems. They have determined that the algorithm produces useful 1-6-h estimates for flash flood monitoring but exaggerates the area of precipitation causing overestimation of 24-h rainfall total associated with slow-moving, cold-topped mesoscale convective systems. The SAB analyses have also shown a tendency for underestimation of rainfall rates in warm-top stratiform cloud systems. Until further improvements, the use of this technique for stratiform events should be considered with caution. The authors validate the hourly rainfall rates of the auto-estimator using gauge-adjusted radar precipitation products (with radar bias removed) in three distinct cases. Results show that the auto-estimator has modest skill at 1-h time resolution for a spatial resolution of 12 km. Results improve with larger grid sizes (48 by 48 km or larger).},

Since the TAR, new observations and related modelling of greenhouse gases, solar activity, land surface properties and some aspects of aerosols have led to improvements in the quantitative estimates of radiative forcing. Carbon dioxide is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas (see Figure SPM.2). The global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm3 in 2005. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years (180 to 300 ppm) as determined from ice cores. The annual carbon dioxide concentration growth rate was larger during the last 10 years (1995–2005 average: 1.9 ppm per year), than it has been since the beginning of continuous direct atmospheric measurements (1960–2005 average: 1.4 ppm per year) although there is year-to-year variability in growth rates. {2.3, 7.3} • The primary source of the increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide since the pre-industrial period results from fossil fuel use, with land-use change providing another signifi cant but smaller contribution.

Both under- and overestimation at low and high sensible heat fluxes by SEBS was discovered. Through sensitivity analyses, it was identified that these biases are related to the SEBS parameterization of bare soil's excess resistance to heat transfer (kB−1, where k is the von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n constant and B−1 is the Stanton number). The kB−1 of bare soil in SEBS was replaced. The results show that the revised model performs better than the original model.},

abstract = {A coupled water balance and water transport model (WBM / WTM) was constructed as part of a larger study of global biogeochemistry. The WBM / WTM provides critical hydrologic information to models of terrestrial primary production, organic matter decay, riverine nutrient flux and trace gas exchanges with the troposphere. Specifically, it creates high‐resolution data sets for monthly soil moisture, evapotranspiration, runoff, river discharge and floodplain inundation. As a first step toward eventual global coverage, the WBM / WTM was applied to South America, represented by more than 5700 1/2° (latitude / longitude) grid cells. The WBM transforms spatially complex data on long‐term climate, vegetation, soils and topography into predictions of soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff (RO). For South America, field capacity in soils ranged from 27 to 582 mm of water, and computed values for mean annual SM, ET and RO were 284 mm, 1059 mm/yr and 619 mm/yr, respectively. There were large differences regionally and over the year. The transport model uses WBM‐derived runoff, information on fluvial topology, linear transfer through river channels and a simple representation of floodplain inundation to generate monthly discharge estimates for any cell within a simulated catchment. The WTM successfully determined the timing and magnitude of discharge at selected locations within the Amazon / Tocantins basin. It also demonstrated the importance of floodplain inundation in defining flow regime on the mainstem Amazon. Estimated mean annual discharge was 207,000 m3/s for the Amazon River and 17,000 m3/s for the Tocantins. in these basins, 45% of the incident precipitation emerges as river flow; 55% is lost to ET. The model described in this paper will be expanded to include the dynamics of carbon, major nutrients and sediments. It will serve as a semimechanistic tool to quantify the transport of materials from the landscape to the world's oceans. Such a capability becomes increasingly important as we seek to understand the impacts of climate and land use change on major river systems of the globe.

abstract = {Satellite derived rainfall products are useful for drought and flood early warning and overcome the problem of sparse, unevenly distributed and erratic rain gauge observations, provided their accuracy is well known. Mozambique is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events such as major droughts and floods and thus, an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different rainfall products is valuable. Three dekadal (10-day) gridded satellite rainfall products (TAMSAT African Rainfall Climatology And Time-series (TARCAT) v2.0, Famine Early Warning System NETwork (FEWS NET) Rainfall Estimate (RFE) v2.0, and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)) are compared to independent gauge data (2001-2012). This is done using pairwise comparison statistics to evaluate the performance in estimating rainfall amounts and categorical statistics to assess rain-detection capabilities. The analysis was performed for different rainfall categories, over the seasonal cycle and for regions dominated by different weather systems. Overall, satellite products overestimate low and underestimate high dekadal rainfall values. The RFE and CHIRPS products perform as good, generally outperforming TARCAT on the majority of statistical measures of skill. TARCAT detects best the relative frequency of rainfall events, while RFE underestimates and CHIRPS overestimates the rainfall events frequency. Differences in products performance disappear with higher rainfall and all products achieve better results during the wet season. During the cyclone season, CHIRPS shows the best results, while RFE outperforms the other products for lower dekadal rainfall.

abstract = {ERA-Interim/Land is a global land surface reanalysis data set covering the period 1979-2010. It describes the evolution of soil moisture, soil temperature and snowpack. ERA-Interim/Land is the result of a single 32-year simulation with the latest ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) land surface model driven by meteorological forcing from the ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis and precipitation adjustments based on monthly GPCP v2.1 (Global Precipitation Climatology Project). The horizontal resolution is about 80 km and the time frequency is 3-hourly. ERA-Interim/Land includes a number of parameterization improvements in the land surface scheme with respect to the original ERA-Interim data set, which makes it more suitable for climate studies involving land water resources. The quality of ERA-Interim/Land is assessed by comparing with ground-based and remote sensing observations. In particular, estimates of soil moisture, snow depth, surface albedo, turbulent latent and sensible fluxes, and river discharges are verified against a large number of site measurements. ERA-Interim/Land provides a global integrated and coherent estimate of soil moisture and snow water equivalent, which can also be used for the initialization of numerical weather prediction and climate models.},

abstract = {This paper shows recent progress in our understanding of climate variability and trends in the Amazon region, and how these interact with land use change. The review includes an overview of up-to-date information on climate and hydrological variability, and on warming trends in Amazonia, which reached 0.6-0.7 °C over the last 40 years, with 2016 as the warmest year since at least 1950 (0.9 °C +0.3°C). We focus on local and remote drivers of climate variability and change. We review the impacts of these drivers on the length of dry season, the role of the forest in climate and carbon cycles, the resilience of the forest, the risk of fires and biomass burning, and the potential “die back” of the Amazon forests if surpassing a “tipping point”. The role of the Amazon in moisture recycling and transport is also investigated, and a review of model development for climate change projections in the region is included. In sum, future sustainability of the Amazonian forests and its many services requires management strategies that consider the likelihood of multi-year droughts superimposed on a continued warming trend. Science has assembled enough knowledge to underline the global and regional importance of an intact Amazon region that can support policymaking and to keep this sensitive ecosystem functioning. This major challenge requires substantial resources and strategic cross-national planning, and a unique blend of expertise and capacities established in Amazon countries and from international collaboration. This also highlights the role of deforestation control in in support of policy for mitigation options as established in the Paris Agreement of 2015.},

abstract = {The accurate modeling of continuum absorption is crucial for the so-called window regions of the spectrum, the relatively transparent regions between lines. The window regions in the microwave are of critical importance for Earth remote sensing and data assimilation. Presented in this paper is an evaluation of the widely used Mlawer, Tobin, Clough, Kneizys, and Davis (MT_CKD) water vapor continuum model in the microwave region, performed using measurements from ground-based radiometers operated by the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program at sites in Oklahoma, USA, and the Black Forest, Germany. The radiometers used were the Radiometrics 23.8/31.4-GHz microwave radiometers (MWRs), the Radiometer Physics GmbH 90/150-GHz MWR at high frequencies (MWRHF), and the Radiometrics 183 GHz G-band vapor radiometer profiler (GVRP). Radiometer measurements were compared with brightness temperatures calculated using radiosonde temperature and humidity profiles input to the monochromatic radiative transfer model (MonoRTM), which uses the MT_CKD continuum model. Measurements at 23.8 GHz were used to correct for biases in the total precipitable water vapor (PWV) from the radiosondes. The long-term 31.4 GHz data set, with a range of PWV values spanning from 0.15 to 5 cm, allowed the separation of uncertainties in the self- and foreign-broadened components of the water vapor continuum. The MT_CKD model has been updated in the microwave region to provide improved agreement with the measurements. MonoRTM has been updated accordingly. The results for the different instruments and frequencies were consistent, providing high confidence in the continuum updates. The estimated uncertainties on the updated continuum coefficients in MT_CKD are 4% on the foreign-broadened water vapor continuum and 4% on the self-broadened water vapor continuum},

abstract = {Satellite derived rainfall products are useful for drought and flood early warning and overcome the problem of sparse, unevenly distributed and erratic rain gauge observations, provided their accuracy is well known. Mozambique is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events such as major droughts and floods and thus, an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different rainfall products is valuable. Three dekadal (10-day) gridded satellite rainfall products (TAMSAT African Rainfall Climatology And Time-series (TARCAT) v2.0, Famine Early Warning System NETwork (FEWS NET) Rainfall Estimate (RFE) v2.0, and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)) are compared to independent gauge data (2001-2012). This is done using pairwise comparison statistics to evaluate the performance in estimating rainfall amounts and categorical statistics to assess rain-detection capabilities. The analysis was performed for different rainfall categories, over the seasonal cycle and for regions dominated by different weather systems. Overall, satellite products overestimate low and underestimate high dekadal rainfall values. The RFE and CHIRPS products perform as good, generally outperforming TARCAT on the majority of statistical measures of skill. TARCAT detects best the relative frequency of rainfall events, while RFE underestimates and CHIRPS overestimates the rainfall events frequency. Differences in products performance disappear with higher rainfall and all products achieve better results during the wet season. During the cyclone season, CHIRPS shows the best results, while RFE outperforms the other products for lower dekadal rainfall. Products blending thermal infrared and passive microwave imagery perform better than infrared only products and particularly when meteorological patterns are more complex, such as over the coastal, central and south regions of Mozambique, where precipitation is influenced by frontal systems.},

abstract = {As scientists are celebrating the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his On the Origin of Species , Darwin's ideas continue to shape and enrich the sciences ([ 1 ][1]). 6 May 2009 marks the 150th anniversary of the death of another 19th-century figure—Alexander von Humboldt—whose scientific legacy also flourishes in the 21st century. Humboldt helped create the intellectual world Darwin inhabited, and his writings inspired Darwin to embark on H.M.S. Beagle . More pertinent to our time, Humboldt established the foundation for the Earth system sciences: the integrated system of knowledge on which human society may depend in the face of global climate change.

Like Darwin, Humboldt undertook a major voyage that would shape his ideas and thinking. Humboldt spent 5 years (1799 to 1804) with botanist Aim{\'{e}} Bonpland exploring Venezuela, the northern Andes, and central Mexico, with visits to Tenerife, Cuba, and the United States. They collected botanical, zoological, geological, and ethnological specimens, made extensive atmospheric and geophysical measurements, and recorded the geographic location of their thousands of specimens and tens of thousands of measurements. Humboldt spent the next 22 years and most of his inherited fortune in Paris, preparing and publishing 45 volumes of a never-finished report on his travels.

Of these volumes, the first was a slim work entitled Essay on the Geography of Plants ([ 2 ][2], [ 3 ][3]). The modest title belies the intellectual richness within. In the text and accompanying color plate (see the figure), Humboldt lays out a vision of a comprehensive “general physics of the Earth” aimed at nothing less than a synthesis of atmospheric, oceanic, geological, ecological, and cultural phenomena across the globe. Humboldt's obsession with geographically referenced measurements and collections was central to his vision. He recognized that spatial arrays of observations could be aggregated to reveal patterns that would in turn reveal underlying processes—such as the distribution of incident radiation, the transport of heat and materials in winds and ocean currents, the influence of temperature on plant form, and the effect of latitude and continentality on mountain snowline.

![Figure][4]</img>

Intellectual riches. 
The central portion of Humboldt's Physical Tableau of the Andes and Neighboring Countries , published as part of ([ 2 ][2], [ 3 ][3]), shows Chimborazo in profile, with vegetation zones, plant species, and snowline depicted at appropriate elevations. In the original, the profile is flanked on both sides by tables describing elevational patterns in temperature, humidity, light refraction and intensity, agriculture, fauna, and other physical, chemical, and biological features.

He expanded this vision in the succeeding years, establishing international cooperative networks of meteorological and geomagnetic measurement stations, inventing isotherms and other graphical devices to portray spatial patterns, and noting that plant form is often better predicted by local environment than by taxonomic affinity (a paradox resolved by Darwin). Humboldt's genius lay in his geographical vision, and in his intuition that Earth's land surface, oceans, atmosphere, and inhabitants form an integrated whole, with linkages among the various components ([ 4 ][5], [ 5 ][6]). Humboldt's general physics of the Earth envisioned climate as a major control of Earth-surface phenomena, with vegetation serving as both an index of climate and a proximal control of microclimate, animal habitat, and cultural practices ([ 6 ][7]–[ 8 ][8]).

Humboldt's dream of systematic observational arrays across the globe took hold in the 19th century. Throughout the century, countless Humboldt-inspired explorations were launched, each involving systematic measurement and mapping of physical, biological, and often cultural features of landscapes and oceans ([ 8 ][8]–[ 10 ][9]). These surveys were relentlessly inductive, typically producing detailed descriptive reports with little integration within or among the component entities. However, for a few intellectually nimble participants—including Charles Darwin, T. H. Huxley, Matthew Maury, Asa Gray, C. Hart Merriam, and Peter Kropotkin—these explorations provided data and experience that spurred the development of biogeography, ecology, oceanography, and other environmental sciences ([ 11 ][10]).

Unfortunately, the conceptual unification among the sciences of the Earth that Humboldt sought never developed in the century following his death. Disciplinary specialization played a large role in eclipsing Humboldt's integration, as did 20th-century trends toward reductionism, experimentalism, and fine-scale processes in many disciplines.

A new incarnation of Humboldt's general physics of the Earth began to emerge with the plate tectonics revolution in the 1960s. Drawing on Humboldtian spatial arrays of observations, this theory provided a unified explanatory framework for disparate geophysical, geological, paleontological, and biogeographic phenomena.

Today, a second, even broader manifestation of Humboldt's vision aspires to understand the interactions and feedbacks among the components of the Earth system, encompassing the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere as well as human societies and economies. This effort is often referred to as Earth system science, but it could just as well be designated “general physics of the Earth,” using the early-19th century definition of physics as the study of the material world and its phenomena (which we now call science).

Global environmental change may be the greatest challenge faced by human societies since the advent of agriculture. Humboldt advocated for science that spoke to human needs and concerns ([ 5 ][6]). It is fitting that on the 150th anniversary of his death, we recognize his role in fostering the sciences that speak to the most profound human concerns—sustainability of human societies and the ecosystems on which they depend.

abstract = {The year 2010 featured a widespread drought in the Amazon rain forest, which was more severe than the "once-in-a-century" drought of 2005. Water levels of major Amazon tributaries fell drastically to unprecedented low values, and isolated the floodplain population whose transportation depends upon on local streams which completely dried up. The drought of 2010 in Amazonia started in early austral summer during El Nio and then was intensified as a consequence of the warming of the tropical North Atlantic. An observed tendency for an increase in dry and very dry events, particularly in southern Amazonia during the dry season, is concomitant with an increase in the length of the dry season. Our results suggest that it is by means of a longer dry season that warming in the tropical North Atlantic affects the hydrology of the Amazon Rivers at the end of the recession period (austral spring). This process is, sometimes, further aggravated by deficient rainfall in the previous wet season. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed.},

Values of the widths obtained using the measurements are 0.0900 cm<sup>-1</sup>/atm with 1.6% uncertainty for the 22-GHz line and 0.0992 cm<sup>-1</sup>/atm with 2.4% uncertainty for the 183-GHz line. Also presented are spectroscopic parameters for these lines from new calculations performed using the complex implementation of the Robert-Bonamy theory (CRB). The CRB values of the air-broadened widths are 0.0913 cm<sup>-1</sup>/atm with 3% uncertainty and a temperature exponent of 0.755 for the 22-GHz line and 0.0997 cm<sup>-1</sup>/atm with 3% uncertainty and a temperature exponent of 0.769 for the 183-GHz line. The values for the air-broadened half-widths derived from the measurement/model comparisons show good agreement with the new CRB calculations. For future versions of MonoRTM, width values of 0.0900 and 0.0997 cm<sup>-1</sup>/atm are to be adopted with temperature dependences of 0.76 and 0.77 for the 22- and 183-GHz lines, respectively},

We show that a transfer scheme recently developed within the Organising Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) LSM significantly improves the simulated land water storage. Over large tropical rivers basins, model results without the transfer scheme provide significantly smaller amplitudes of water storage than observed by GRACE. Including the transfer scheme that accounts for water stored in the river systems and aquifers during its transfer to the oceans leads to predicted land water storage that are comparable to GRACE observations. Water stored in aquifers contributes about half the seasonal variation of water storage over large basins such as the Amazon, Congo, Yangtze, Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Mekong.

abstract = {Nine satellite rainfall estimations (SREs) were evaluated for the first time over the South American Andean plateau watershed by comparison with rain gauge data acquired between 2005 and 2007. The comparisons were carried out at the annual, monthly and daily time steps. All SREs reproduce the salient pattern of the annual rain field, with a marked north–south gradient and a lighter east–west gradient. However, the intensity of the gradient differs among SREs: it is well marked in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42 (TMPA-3B42), Precipitation Estimation from remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) products, and it is smoothed out in the Climate prediction center MORPHing (CMORPH) products. Another interesting difference among products is the contrast in rainfall amounts between the water surfaces (Lake Titicaca) and the surrounding land. Some products (TMPA-3B42, PERSIANN and GSMaP) show a contradictory rainfall deficit over Lake Titicaca, which may be due to the emissivity contrast between the lake and the surrounding lands and warm rain cloud processes. An analysis differentiating coastal Lake Titicaca from inland pixels confirmed this trend. The raw or Real Time (RT) products have strong biases over the study region. These biases are strongly positive for PERSIANN (above 90%), moderately positive for TMPA-3B42 (28%), strongly negative for CMORPH (− 42%) and moderately negative for GSMaP (− 18%). The biases are associated with a deformation of the rain rate frequency distribution: GSMaP underestimates the proportion of rainfall events for all rain rates; CMORPH overestimates the proportion of rain rates below 2 mm day − 1 ; and the other products tend to overestimate the proportion of moderate to high rain rates. These biases are greatly reduced by the gauge adjustment in the TMPA-3B42, PERSIANN and CMORPH products, whereas a negative bias becomes positive for GSMaP. TMPA-3B42 Adjusted (Adj) version 7 demonstrates the best overall agreement with gauges in terms of correlation, rain rate distribution and bias. However, PERSIANN-Adj's bias in the southern part of the domain is very low.},

TMPA is available both after and in real time, based on calibration by the TRMM Combined Instrument and TRMM Microwave Imager precipitation products, respectively. Only the after-real-time product incorporates gauge data at the present. The dataset covers the latitude band 50°N–S for the period from 1998 to the delayed present. Early validation results are as follows: the TMPA provides reasonable performance at monthly scales, although it is shown to have precipitation rate–dependent low bias due to lack of sensitivity to low precipitation rates over ocean in one of the input products [based on Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B)]. At finer scales the TMPA is successful at approximately reproducing the s...},

abstract = {The Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is a set of algorithms dedicated to the estimation of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture from satellite data. Ever since its development in 2011, the model has been regularly revised aiming at the optimal incorporation of new satellite-observed geophysical variables, and improving the representation of physical processes. In this study, the next version of this model (v3) is presented. Key changes relative to the previous version include: (1) a revised formulation of the evaporative stress, (2) an optimized drainage algorithm, and (3) a new soil moisture data assimilation system. GLEAM v3 is used to produce three new data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture, including a 35-year data set spanning the period 1980&ndash;2014 (v3.0a, based on satellite-observed soil moisture, vegetation optical depth and snow water equivalents, reanalysis air temperature and radiation, and a multi-source precipitation product), and two fully satellite-based data sets. The latter two share most of their forcing, except for the vegetation optical depth and soil moisture products, which are based on observations from different passive and active C- and L-band microwave sensors (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative data sets) for the first data set (v3.0b, spanning the period 2003&ndash;2015) and observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite in the second data set (v3.0c, spanning the period 2011&ndash;2015). These three data sets are described in detail, compared against analogous data sets generated using the previous version of GLEAM (v2), and validated against measurements from 64 eddy-covariance towers and 2338 soil moisture sensors across a broad range of ecosystems. Results indicate that the quality of the v3 soil moisture is consistently better than the one from v2: average correlations against in situ surface soil moisture measurements increase from 0.61 to 0.64 in case of the v3.0a data set and the representation of soil moisture in the second layer improves as well, with correlations increasing from 0.47 to 0.53. Similar improvements are observed for the two fully satellite-based data sets. Despite regional differences, the quality of the evaporation fluxes remains overall similar as the one obtained using the previous version of GLEAM, with average correlations against eddy-covariance measurements between 0.78 and 0.80 for the three different data sets. These global data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture are now openly available at http://GLEAM.eu and may be used for large-scale hydrological applications, climate studies and research on land-atmosphere feedbacks.},

abstract = {Like civilization and technology, our understanding of the global water cycle has been continuously evolving, and we have adapted our quantification methods to better exploit new technological resources. The accurate quantification of global water fluxes and storages is crucial in studying the global water cycle. These fluxes and storages physically interact with each other, are related through the water budget, and are constrained by it. First attempts to quantify them date back to the early 1900s, and during the past few decades, they have received an increasing research interest, which is reflected in the vast amount of data sources available nowadays. However, these data have not been comprehensive enough due to the high spatiotemporal variability of the global water cycle. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the chronological evolution of global water cycle quantification, the distinct data sources and methods used, and a critical assessment of their contribution to improving the spatiotemporal monitoring of the global water cycle. The chronology of global water cycle components shows that the uncertainty of flux estimates over oceans remains higher than that over land. Comparing the standard deviation and the interquartile range of the estimates from the 2000s onward with those from all the estimates (1905-2019), we can affirm that statistical variability has diminished in recent years. Moreover, the variability of ocean precipitation and evaporation estimates from the 2000 onward was reduced by more than

Other ground truth such as Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) and ground report is also included in the validation. Based on 16 validation cases in the years 2014-18, the average match ratio between surface snowfall flag from space radar and ground radar is around 87.8%.

Under the auspices of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Radiation Panel, the SEAFLUX Project has been initiated to investigate producing a high-resolution satellite-based dataset of surface turbulent fluxes over the global oceans to complement the existing products for surface radiation fluxes and precipitation.

This study is composed of two companion papers; this first part introduces some theoretical considerations. The goal of this study is, first, to identify the various forms of synergy for remote sensing applications. Simple linear models are used to introduce concepts such as additive, unmixing, indirect, or denoising synergies. The second objective of this paper is to develop a methodology to measure, in real-world applications, these different synergies. For this purpose, some experiments are conducted using the classical information content analysis which is often used in the context of assimilation or to design new instruments. This technique is tested on a real-world application where the microwave and infrared observations from the Atmospheric Microwave Sounding Unit-A, Microwave Humidity Sounder, and Improved Atmospheric Sounding in the Infrared instruments are used to retrieve the atmospheric profiles of temperature and water vapor over ocean, under clear-sky conditions. This approach will show its limitation to measure synergy and stress the need for other tools. In the companion paper, statistical retrieval schemes will show their potential to measure and exploit existing synergies, for the same application.},

abstract = {Freshwater discharge from the continents is a key component of Earth's water cycle that sustains human life and ecosystem health. Surprisingly, owing to a number of socioeconomic and political ob-stacles, a comprehensive global river discharge observing system does not yet exist. Here we use 13 years (1994–2006) of satellite precipitation, evaporation, and sea level data in an ocean mass balance to estimate freshwater discharge into the global ocean. Results indicate that global freshwater discharge averaged 36,055 km 3 ∕y for the study period while exhibiting significant interannual variability driven primarily by El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscil-lation cycles. The method described here can ultimately be used to estimate long-term global discharge trends as the records of sea level rise and ocean temperature lengthen. For the relatively short 13-year period studied here, global discharge increased by 540 km 3 ∕y 2 , which was largely attributed to an increase of global-ocean evaporation (768 km 3 ∕y 2). Sustained growth of these flux rates into long-term trends would provide evidence for increasing intensity of the hydrologic cycle. climate ∣ global water cycle ∣ hydrology ∣ remote sensing ∣ observations F reshwater discharge into the world ocean is a key component of Earth's global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, which plays a critical role in supporting the human environment and ecosystem health. It represents an integrated response to nat-ural processes and to anthropogenic activities, exhibiting promi-nent variability in magnitude, seasonality, and response to future climate warming scenarios (1). Increasing precipitation intensity (2) and greenhouse gas emissions point to significant changes in river runoff, particularly at high latitudes (3). Although human management of water resources, including reservoir storage and excessive groundwater withdrawal, have altered the flow regime of some major river basins (4, 5), global-scale discharge changes remain a key indicator of potential acceleration of the hydrologic cycle (6, 7) and an important input for quantifying rates of global mean sea level rise (8). Recent discussion of the intensification of the hydrological cycle has included analysis of trends in global freshwater discharge (9–12) that may be occurring in response to increasing evaporation. However, a major limitation in these analyses has been the availability of spatially and temporally consistent, quality-controlled observations of river discharge (13). Meth-odologies to counter this deficiency are often highly debated (14, 15). Although most global discharge assessments to date have been based on aggregated gauge-based streamflow measure-ments, strong socioeconomic disincentives for sharing data, a worldwide decline in the number of operational gauging stations, and incomplete measurement of total volume of freshwater discharged along continental margins, combine to severely limit the capacity of gauging networks to characterize the behavior of global freshwater discharge in near real-time (16, 17). Conse-quently, most prior attempts have focused on climatologic or annual averages taken over historical periods of varying length (18 and references therein). Recent advances in remote sensing techniques, particularly in the use of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (16) and radar altimetry (19), provide alternatives to overcome some of the limitations of monitoring river discharge and other surface water bodies encountered using ground-based measurements (16). The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission (20) provides another option for remote sensing of river discharge from large river basin to continental scales. Terrestrial water storage observations from GRACE, when combined with precipitation and evaporation data (or similarly, with the atmo-spheric moisture storage change and divergence), can be used to solve a water balance for the discharge flux (17, 21). This method presents the most viable means to estimate discharge in near-real time, although it is limited to the period of available land-water storage observations from the GRACE mission (March 2002— present) and its spatial-temporal accuracy range (>150;000 km 2 ; >10 days). Here we present and analyze monthly variations of global freshwater discharge, extending from 1994 to 2006, computed utilizing satellite and in situ observations in a global-ocean mass balance. The length of the computed discharge is primarily gov-erned by the availability of the ocean temperature observations. We emphasize that the computed freshwater discharge estimates do not require additional statistical analysis and/or model (time-integrating) simulations to account for the spatial and temporal inconsistencies or to fill data gaps that are typical of gauge-based river discharge observations. Furthermore, the results presented here are the only available estimates of observation-based global discharge computed on a monthly basis over an extended period (13 y; 1994–2006) from the recent past.},

abstract = {Spatial water resource monitoring systems (SWRMS) can provide valuable information in support of water management, but current operational systems are few and provide only a subset of the information required. Necessary innovations include the explicit description of water redistribution and water use from river and groundwater systems, achieving greater spatial detail (particularly in key features such as irrigated areas and wetlands), and improving accuracy as assessed against hydrometric observations, as well as assimilating those observations. The Australian water resources assessment (AWRA) system aims to achieve this by coupling landscape models with models describing surface water and groundwater dynamics and water use. A review of operational and research applications demonstrates that satellite observations can improve accuracy and spatial detail in hydrological model estimation. All operational systems use dynamic forcing, land cover classifications and a priori parameterisation of vegetation dynamics that are partially or wholly derived from remote sensing. Satellite observations are used to varying degrees in model evaluation and data assimilation. The utility of satellite observations through data assimilation can vary as a function of dominant hydrological processes. Opportunities for improvement are identified, including the development of more accurate and higher spatial and temporal resolution precipitation products, and the use of a greater range of remote sensing products in a priori model parameter estimation, model evaluation and data assimilation. Operational challenges include the continuity of research satellite missions and data services, and the need to find computationally-efficient data assimilation techniques. The successful use of observations critically depends on the availability of detailed information on observational error and understanding of the relationship between remotely-sensed and model variables, as affected by conceptual discrepancies and spatial and temporal scaling.},

First, the purely satellite-based CMORPH precipitation estimates (raw CMORPH) are reprocessed. The integration algorithm is fixed and the input level 2 passive microwave (PMW) retrievals of instantaneous precipitation rates are from identical versions throughout the entire data period. Bias correction is then performed for the raw CMORPH through probability density function (PDF) matching against the CPC daily gauge analysis over land and through adjustment against the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) pentad merged analysis of precipitation over ocean. The reprocessed, bias-corrected CMORPH exhibits improved performance in representing the magnitude, spatial distribution patterns, and temporal variations of precipitation over the global domain from 60°S to 60°N. Bias in the CMORPH satellite precipitation estimates is almost completely removed over land during warm seasons (May-September), while during cold seasons (October-April) CMORPH tends to underestimate the precipitation due to the less-than-desirable performance of the current-generation PMW retrievals in detecting and quantifying snowfall and cold season rainfall. An intercomparison study indicated that the reprocessed, bias-corrected CMORPH exhibits consistently superior performance than the widely used TRMM 3B42 (TMPA) in representing both daily and 3-hourly precipitation over the contiguous United States and other global regions.},

abstract = {Cirrus clouds determine the radiative balance of the upper troposphere and the transport of water vapor across the tropopause. The representation of vertical wind velocity, W, in atmospheric models constitutes the largest source of uncertainty in the calculation of the cirrus formation rate. Using global atmospheric simulations with a spatial resolution of 7 km we obtain for the first time a direct estimate of the distribution of W at the scale relevant for cirrus formation, validated against long-term observations at two different ground sites. The standard deviation in W, $\sigma$ w, varies widely over the globe with the highest values resulting from orographic uplift and convection, and the lowest occurring in the Arctic. Globally about 90% of the simulated $\sigma$ w values are below 0.1 m s-1 and about one in 104 cloud formation events occur in environments with $\sigma$ w > 0.8 m s-1. Combining our estimate with reanalysis products and an advanced cloud formation scheme results in lower homogeneous ice nucleation frequency than previously reported, and a decreasing average ice crystal concentration with decreasing temperature. These features are in agreement with observations and suggest that the correct parameterization of $\sigma$ w is critical to simulate realistic cirrus properties.},

The precipitation datasets contain gauge-based data [data derived from the Hybam Observatory Precipitation (HOP) dataset and provided by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC)], satellite-based data [the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) one-degree daily and TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) datasets] and model-based data [the NCEP-DOE AMIP-II re-analysis (NCEP-2) and 40-year ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) datasets]. Each dataset has a common set of meteorological forcing data which are used to run the MGB-IPH hydrological model for the period from January 1998 to August 2002.The average precipitation of all the datasets is 2542. mm for the Negro River basin, with a standard deviation of 317. mm. TMPA and NCEP-2 have the lowest (2216. mm/year) and the highest (3065. mm/year) precipitation rates, respectively. The HOP and CPC datasets agree best with observed discharge. GPCP gives the best results among the ungauged datasets, followed by ERA-40. TMPA and NCEP-2 are found to be the least accurate. TMPA can reproduce the water cycles reasonably well, but underestimates the precipitation fields and discharges over the basin, while NCEP-2 is unable to represent the rainfall quantity and cycles, and the water discharge. Results suggest that gauge-based data are still the most representative of the actual precipitation in the northern Amazon basin. However, some satellite and model-based can reproduce fairly well the water cycle at the basin scale and monthly time step. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, we assess groundwater's role in the Amazon surface water dynamics using a continental-scale coupled groundwater-surface water model (LEAF-Hydro-Flood) forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis, at 2km and 4min resolution over 11years (2000-2010). The simulation is validated with observed streamflow, water table depth and flooding extent. A parallel simulation without groundwater is conducted to isolate its effect. Our findings support the following hypotheses. First, in the headwater catchments, groundwater dominates streamflow; the observed variations in its dominance across the Amazon can be explained by the varying water table depth. Second, over large floodplains, there are two-way exchanges between floodwater and groundwater as infiltration in the wet season and seepage in the dry season, and the direction and magnitude are controlled by the water table depth. Third, the Amazon harbors large areas of wetlands that are rarely under floodwater and difficult to observe by remote sensing, but are maintained by a persistently shallow water table. Fourth, due to its delayed and muted response to rainfall, groundwater seepage persists in the dry season, buffering surface waters through seasonal droughts. Our simulations shed new lights on the spatial-temporal structures of the hidden subsurface hydrologic pathways across the Amazon and suggest possible mechanisms whereby groundwater actively participates in the Amazon water-carbon cycle such as CO<inf>2</inf> outgassing from groundwater seeps and CH<inf>4</inf> emission from groundwater-supported wetlands. {\textcopyright} 2012.

We use water levels in the Amazon River to quantify changes in extreme events and then analyze their cause. Despite continuing research emphasis on droughts, the largest change over recent decades is a marked increase in very severe floods. Increased flooding is linked to a strengthening of the Walker circulation, resulting from strong tropical Atlantic warming and tropical Pacific cooling. Atlantic warming due to combined anthropogenic and natural factors has contributed to enhance the change in atmospheric circulation. Whether this anomalous increase in flooding will last depends on the evolution of the tropical inter-ocean temperature difference.},

abstract = {AbstractThe analysis of the affect of weather and climate on human activities requires the construction of impact models that are able to describe the complex links between weather and socioeconomic data. In practice, one of the biggest challenges is the lack of data, because it is generally difficult to obtain time series that are long enough. As a consequence, derived impact models predict well the historical record but are unable to perform well on real forecasts. To avoid this data-limitation problem, it is possible to train the impact model over a large spatial domain by {\textquotedblleft}pooling{\textquotedblright} data from multiple locations. This general impact model needs to be spatially corrected to take local conditions into account, however. This is particularly true, for example, in agriculture: it is not efficient to pool all of the spatial data into a single very general impact model, but it is also not efficient to develop one impact model for each spatial location. To solve these aggregation problems, mixed-effects (ME) mo...},

abstract = {Deep learning models, especially the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are very active in hyperspectral remote sensing image classification. In order to better apply the CNN model to hyperspectral classification, we propose a CNN model based on Fletcher-Reeves algorithm (F-R CNN), which uses the Fletcher-Reeves (F-R) algorithm for gradient updating to optimize the convergence performance of the model in classification. In view of the fact that there are fewer optional training samples in practical applications, we further propose a method of increasing the number of samples by adding a certain degree of perturbed samples, which can also test the anti-interference ability of classification methods. Furthermore, we analyze the anti-interference and convergence performance of the proposed model in terms of different training sample data sets, different batch training sample numbers and iteration time. In this paper, we describe the experimental process in detail and comprehensively evaluate the proposed model based on the classification of CHRIS hyperspectral imagery covering coastal wetlands, and further evaluate it on a commonly used hyperspectral image benchmark dataset. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the two models after increasing training samples and adjusting the number of batch training samples is improved. When the number of batch training samples is continuously increased to 350, the classification accuracy of the proposed method can still be maintained above 80.7%, which is 2.9% higher than the traditional one. And its time consumption is less than that of the traditional one while ensuring classification accuracy. It can be concluded that the proposed method has anti-interference ability and outperforms the traditional CNN in terms of batch computing adaptability and convergence speed.},

abstract = {Efficient and responsible management of water resources relies on accurate streamflow records. However, many watersheds are ungaged, limiting the ability to assess and understand local hydrology. Several tools have been developed to alleviate this data scarcity, but few provide continuous daily streamflow records at individual streamgages within an entire region. Building on the history of hydrologic mapping, ordinary kriging was extended to predict daily streamflow time series on a regional basis. Pooling parameters to estimate a single, time-invariant characterization of spatial semivariance structure is shown to produce accurate reproduction of streamflow. This approach is contrasted with a time-varying series of variograms, representing the temporal evolution and behavior of the spatial semivariance structure. Furthermore, the ordinary kriging approach is shown to produce more accurate time series than more common, single-index hydrologic transfers. A comparison between topological kriging and ordinary kriging is less definitive, showing the ordinary kriging approach to be significantly inferior in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiencies while maintaining significantly superior performance measured by root mean squared errors. Given the similarity of performance and the computational efficiency of ordinary kriging, it is concluded that ordinary kriging is useful for first-order approximation of daily streamflow time series in ungaged watersheds.},

abstract = {algorithm has been developed that employs neural network technology to retrieve soil moisture from multi-wavelength satellite observations (active/passive microwave, infrared, and visible). This represents the first step in the development of a methodology aiming to combine beneficial aspects of existing retrieval schemes. Several quality metrics have been developed to assess the performance of a retrieval product on different spatial and temporal scales. Additionally, an innovative approach to estimate the retrieval uncertainty has been proposed. An information content analysis of different satellite observations showed that active microwave observations are best suited to capture the soil moisture temporal variability, while the amplitude of the surface temperature diurnal cycle is best suited to capture the spatial variability. In a synergy analysis, it has been found that through the combination of all observations the retrieval uncertainty could be reduced by 13%. Furthermore, it was found that synergy benefits are significantly larger using a data fusion approach compared to an a posteriori combination of retrieval products, supporting the combination of different retrieval methodology aspects in a single algorithm. In a comparison with model data, it was found that the proposed methodology also shows potential to be used for the evaluation of modeled soil moisture. A comparison with in situ observations showed that the algorithm is well able to capture soil moisture spatial variabilities. It was concluded that the temporal performance can be improved through incorporation of other existing retrieval approaches.},

abstract = {Reliable identification of clouds is necessary for any type of optical remote sensing image analysis, especially in operational and fully automatic setups. One of the most elaborated and widespread algorithms, namely Fmask, was initially developed for the Landsat suite of satellites. Despite their similarity, application to Sentinel-2 imagery is currently hampered by the unavailability of a thermal band, and although results can be improved when taking the cirrus band into account, Sentinel-2 cloud detections are unsatisfactory in two points. (1) Low altitude clouds can be undetectable in the cirrus band, and (2) bright land surfaces – especially built-up structures – are often misclassified as clouds when only considering spectral information. In this paper, we present the Cloud Displacement Index (CDI), which makes use of the three highly correlated near infrared bands that are observed with different view angles. Hence, elevated objects like clouds are observed under a parallax and can be reliably separated from bright ground objects. We compare CDI with the currently used cloud probabilities, and propose how to integrate this new functionality into the Fmask algorithm. We validate the approach using test images over metropolitan areas covering a wide variety of global environments and climates, indicating the successful separation of clouds and built-up structures (overall accuracy 95%, i.e. an improvement in overall accuracy of 0.29–0.39 compared to the previous Fmask versions over the 20 test sites), and hence a full compensation for a missing thermal band.},

Although 1-D and 2-D comparisons have already been performed at reach and local scales, model differences at regional scale are poorly understood. Moreover, there is a need to improve the coupling between hydrological and hydrodynamic models. It is addressed here by applying the MGB model at 1-D and 2-D dimensions for the whole $\sim$700,000 km2 Negro basin (Amazon), which presents different wetland types. Long-term continuous simulations are performed and validated with multisatellite observations of hydraulic variables. Results showed that both approaches are similarly able to estimate discharges and water levels along main rivers, especially considering parameter uncertainties, but differ in terms of flood extent and volume and water levels in complex wetlands. In these latter, the diffuse flow and drainage patterns were more realistically represented by the 2-D scheme, as well as wetland connectivity across the basin. The 2-D model led to higher drainage basinwide, while the 1-D model was more sensitive to hydrodynamic parameters for discharge and flood extent and had a similar sensitivity for water levels. Finally, tests on the coupling between hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes suggested that their representation in an online way is less important for tropical wetlands than model dimensionality, which largely impacts water transfer and repartition.},

abstract = {This review surveys current and emerging drought monitoring approaches using satellite remote sensing observations from climatological and ecosystem perspectives. We argue that satellite observations not currently used for operational drought monitoring, such as near-surface air relative humidity data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder mission, provide opportunities to improve early drought warning. Current and future satellite missions offer opportunities to develop composite and multi-indicator drought models. While there are immense opportunities, there are major challenges including data continuity, unquantified uncertainty, sensor changes, and community acceptability. One of the major limitations of many of the currently available satellite observations is their short length of record. A number of relevant satellite missions and sensors (e.g., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) provide only a decade of data, which may not be sufficient to study droughts from a climate perspective. However, they still provide valuable information about relevant hydrologic and ecological processes linked to this natural hazard. Therefore, there is a need for models and algorithms that combine multiple data sets and/or assimilate satellite observations into model simulations to generate long-term climate data records. Finally, the study identifies a major gap in indicators for describing drought impacts on the carbon and nitrogen cycle, which are fundamental to assessing drought impacts on ecosystems.},

The resulting database has exceeded 200 yr in temporal coverage and has acquired data from more than 85 000 stations worldwide. Based on this database, this paper provides the reference publication for the four globally gridded monthly precipitation products of the GPCC, covering a 111-yr analysis period from 1901&ndash;present. As required for a reference publication, the content of the product portfolio, as well as the underlying methodologies to process and interpolate are detailed. Moreover, we provide information on the systematic and statistical errors associated with the data products. Finally, sample applications provide potential users of GPCC data products with suitable advice on capabilities and constraints of the gridded data sets. In doing so, the capabilities to access El Ni{\~{n}}o&ndash;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) sensitive precipitation regions and to perform trend analyses across the past 110 yr are demonstrated.

abstract = {Monitoring coherently the Amazon Water Cycle (WC) using satellite observations is crucial for climate and water resources studies. The SAtellite Water Cycle (SAWC) integration methodology is introduced to optimize the satellite datasets. In this paper, the WC budget is balanced simultaneously over 10 sub-basins by constraining the horizontal water exchanges between them. Compared to an actual assimilation analysis, SAWC benefits from the use of water storage observations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. SAWC corrects the satellite evapotranspiration datasets that tend to under-estimate the water-limited evaporation over the central Amazon and to over-estimate the energy-limited evaporation over the northern Amazon. The SAWC precipitation estimates are evaluated against gauge measurements and show good overall results with a correlation varying from 0.94 to 0.99 and root-mean-square deviation between 16 and 41 mm/month (≃10% of precipitation estimate).},

abstract = {Climate change can significantly influence terrestrial water changes around the world particularly in places that have been proven to be more vulnerable such as Bangladesh. In the past few decades, climate impacts, together with those of excessive human water use have changed the country's water availability structure. In this study, we use multi-mission remotely sensed measurements along with a hydrological model to separately analyze groundwater and soil moisture variations for the period 2003–2013, and their interactions with rainfall in Bangladesh. To improve the model's estimates of water storages, terrestrial water storage (TWS) data obtained from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission are assimilated into the World-Wide Water Resources Assessment (W3RA) model using the ensemble-based sequential technique of the Square Root Analysis (SQRA) filter. We investigate the capability of the data assimilation approach to use a non-regional hydrological model for a regional case study. Based on these estimates, we investigate relationships between the model derived sub-surface water storage changes and remotely sensed precipitations, as well as altimetry-derived river level variations in Bangladesh by applying the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. A larger correlation is found between river level heights and rainfalls (78% on average) in comparison to groundwater storage variations and rainfalls (57% on average). The results indicate a significant decline in groundwater storage (∼32% reduction) for Bangladesh between 2003 and 2013, which is equivalent to an average rate of 8.73 ± 2.45mm/year.},

abstract = {Despite the very active deforestation of the last decade, the Amazon Basin is still primarily covered with trees and is a system in equilibrium. The Andes form a barrier at the western end of the basin and, coupled with the prevailing easterly winds, ensure an almost unique precipitation and water-recycling regime. On average 50 percent of the precipitation is recycled, and in some areas even more. The soils are poor. Most of the nitrogen and phosphorus is found in the soil, and the remaining nutrient elements are found in the standing biomass. There is some nutrient recycling and little loss from the intact ecosystem, and the small input of nutrients from precipitation maintains a small positive nutrient balance. Continued large-scale deforestation is likely to lead to increased erosion and water runoff with initial flooding in the lower Amazon, together with reduced evapotranspiration and ultimately reduced precipitation. Reduced precipitation in the Amazon could increase the tendency toward continentality and adversely affect climate and the present agriculture in south-central Brazil.},

abstract = {Evaluating the reliability of satellite and reanalysis precipitation products is critical but challenging over ungauged or poorly gauged regions. The Triple Collocation (TC) method is a reliable approach to estimate the accuracy of any three independent inputs in the absence of truth values. This study assesses the uncertainty of three types of independent precipitation products, i.e., satellite-based, ground-based and model reanalysis over Mainland China using the TC method. The ground-based data set is Gauge Based Daily Precipitation Analysis (CGDPA). The reanalysis data set is European Reanalysis Agency Reanalysis Product (ERA-interim). The satellite-based products include five mainstream satellite products. The comparison and evaluation are conducted at 0.25° and daily resolutions from 2013 to 2015. First, the effectiveness of the TC method is evaluated in South China with dense gauge network. The results demonstrate that the TC method is reliable because the correlation coefficient (CC) and root mean square error (RMSE) derived from TC are close to those derived from ground observations, with only 9% and 7% mean relative differences, respectively. Then, the TC method is applied in Mainland China, with special attention paid to the Tibetan Plateau (TP) known as the Earth's third pole with few ground stations. Results indicate that (1) The overall performance of IMERG is better than the other satellite products over Mainland China, followed by 3B42V7, CMORPH-CRT and PERSIANN-CDR. (2) In the TP, CGDPA shows the best overall performance over gauged grid cells, however, over ungauged regions, IMERG and ERA-interim slightly outperform CGDPA with similar RMSE but higher mean CC (0.63, 0.61, and 0.58, respectively). It highlights the strengths and potentiality of remote sensing and reanalysis data over the TP and reconfirms the cons of the inherent uncertainty of CGDPA due to interpolation from sparsely gauged data. The study concludes that the TC method provides not only reliable cross-validation results over Mainland China but also a new perspective for comparatively assessing multi-source precipitation products, particularly over poorly gauged regions such as the TP.},

abstract = {Water level dynamics in continental-scale rivers is an important factor for surface water studies and flood hazard management. However, most continental-scale river models have not focused on the reproduction of water level because the storage and movement of surface waters are regulated by smaller-scale topography than their grid resolutions. Here we analyzed the water level dynamics simulated by a state-of-the-art global river model, CaMa-Flood, with subgrid representation of floodplain topography. As a case study, hydrodynamics simulation in the Amazon River was accomplished, and the simulated water surface elevations along the main stem were compared against Envisat altimetry. The seasonal cycles of the simulated water surface elevations are in agreement with the altimetry (correlation coefficient >0.69, annual amplitude error <1.6 m). The accuracy of absolute water surface elevations was also good (averaged RMSE of 1.83 m), and the associated errors were within the range of the model uncertainty due to channel cross-section parameters. Then the ocean tide variation at river mouth was incorporated for simulating the tidal effect in the inland Amazon basin, which requires realistic representation of absolute water surface elevations. By applying power spectra analysis to the simulated water level variations, the 15 day cycle due to spring and neap tides was detected at Obidos, located 800 km upstream from the river mouth. The reproduction of the ocean tide propagation to the inland region suggests that CaMa-Flood includes the main physical processes needed to accurately simulate the water level dynamics in continental-scale rivers. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {Simultaneous rainfall analyses using Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave measurements and thermal infrared measurements from Meteosat are presented for two storms over northern Italy that caused damaging floods. Upwelling brightness temperatures over precipitating clouds in the mm-cm spectrum are directly associated with precipitation microphysics throughout the cloud column down into the rain layer. In contrast, brightness temperatures in the thermal infrared window, which arise from emission near cloud top, are not directly responsive to precipitation processes. However, because of the diffraction-limited nature of passive microwave detectors, microwave radiometer ground footprints are considerably larger than those characteristic of infrared sensors, even those flown at geosynchronous altitude. Furthermore, passive microwave radiometers are flown on low-earth orbiters, which produce less than ideal sampling rates, whereas optical-infrared radiometers flown on geosynchronous orbiters produce high frequency sampling concomitant with precipitation time scales. In this study, we investigate how these two types of measuring systems could be used in a complementary fashion to improve rainfall estimation. A physically based microwave algorithm is used to estimate rainfall with SSM/I measurements, whereas a two-threshold statistical technique is used for corresponding estimates from Meteosat. Results suggest that an infrared-based analysis of rainfall derived from half-hourly geosynchronous images can be improved with a calibration-transfer approach using a microwave algorithm sensitive to vertical cloud structure.},

abstract = {A key aspect of large river basins partially neglected in large-scale hydrological models is river hydrodynamics. Large-scale hydrologic models normally simulate river hydrodynamics using simplified models that do not represent aspects such as backwater effects and flood inundation, key factors for some of the largest rivers of the world, such as the Amazon. In a previous paper, we have described a large-scale hydrodynamic approach resultant from an improvement of the MGB-IPH hydrological model. It uses full Saint Venant equations, a simple storage model for flood inundation and GIS-based algorithms to extract model parameters from digital elevation models. In the present paper, we evaluate this model in the Solim{\~{o}}es River basin. Discharge results were validated using 18 stream gauges showing that the model is accurate. It represents the large delay and attenuation of flood waves in the Solim{\~{o}}es basin, while simplified models, represented here by Muskingum Cunge, provide hydrographs are wrongly noisy and in advance. Validation against 35 stream gauges shows that the model is able to simulate observed water levels with accuracy, representing their amplitude of variation and timing. The model performs better in large rivers, and errors concentrate in small rivers possibly due to uncertainty in river geometry. The validation of flood extent results using remote sensing estimates also shows that the model accuracy is comparable to other flood inundation modelling studies. Results show that (i) river-floodplain water exchange and storage, and (ii) backwater effects play an important role for the Amazon River basin hydrodynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We study climate sensitivity and feedback processes in three independent ways: (1) by using a three dimensional (3-D) global climate model for experiments in which solar irradiance S0 is increased 2 percent or CO2 is doubled, (2) by using the CLIMAP climate boundary conditions to analyze the contributions of different physical processes to the cooling of the last ice age (18K years ago), and (3) by using estimated changes in global temperature and the abundance of atmospheric greenhouse gases to deduce an empirical climate sensitivity for the period 1850-1980. Our 3-D global climate model yields a warming of {\$\sim${ }}4{\textdegree}C for either a 2 percent increase of S0 or doubled CO2. This indicates a net feedback factor of f = 3-4, because either of these forcings would cause the earth's surface temperature to warm 1.2-1.3{\textdegree}C to restore radiative balance with space, if other factors remained unchanged. Principal positive feedback processes in the model are changes in atmospheric water vapor, clouds and snow/ice cover. Feedback factors calculated for these processes, with atmospheric dynamical feedbacks implicitly incorporated, are respectively fwater vapor {\$\sim${ }} 1.6, fclouds {\$\sim${ }} 1.3 and fsnow/ice {\$\sim${ }} 1.1 with the latter mainly caused by sea ice changes. A number of potential feedbacks, such as land ice cover, vegetation cover and ocean heat transport were held fixed in these experiments. We calculate land ice, sea ice and vegetation feedbacks for the 18K climate to be fland ice {\$\sim${ }} 1.2-1.3, fsea ice {\$\sim${ }} 1.2 and fvegetation {\$\sim${ }} 1.05-1.1 from their effect on the radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere. This sea ice feedback at 18K is consistent with the smaller fsnow/ice {\$\sim${ }} 1.1 in the S0 and CO2 experiments, which applied to a warmer earth with less sea ice. We also obtain an empirical estimate of f = 2-4 for the fast feedback processes (water vapor, clouds, sea ice) operating on 10-100 year time scales by comparing the cooling due to slow or specified changes (land ice, C02, vegetation) to the total cooling at 18K. The temperature increase believed to have occurred in the past 130 years (approximately 0.5{\textdegree}C) is also found to imply a climate sensitivity of 2.5-5{\textdegree}C for doubled C02 (f = 2-4), if (1) the temperature increase is due to the added greenhouse gases, (2) the 1850 CO2 abundance was 270{\textpm}10 ppm, and (3) the heat perturbation is mixed like a passive tracer in the ocean with vertical mixing coefficient k {\$\sim${ }} 1 cm2 s-1. These analyses indicate that f is substantially greater than unity on all time scales. Our best estimate for the current climate due to processes operating on the 10-100 year time scale is f = 2-4, corresponding to a climate sensitivity of 2.5-5{\textdegree}C for doubled CO2. The physical process contributing the greatest uncertainty to f on this time scale appears to be the cloud feedback. We show that the ocean's thermal relaxation time depends strongly on f. The e-folding time constant for response of the isolated ocean mixed layer is about 15 years, for the estimated value of f. This time is sufficiently long to allow substantial heat exchange between the mixed layer and deeper layers. For f = 3-4 the response time of the surface temperature to a heating perturbation is of order 100 years, if the perturbation is sufficiently small that it does not alter the rate of heat exchange with the deeper ocean. The climate sensitivity we have inferred is larger than that stated in the Carbon Dioxide Assessment Committee report (CDAC, 1983). Their result is based on the empirical temperature increase in the past 130 years, but their analysis did not account for the dependence of the ocean response time on climate sensitivity. Their choice of a fixed 15 year response time biased their result to low sensitivities. We infer that, because of recent increases in atmospheric CO2 and trace gases, there is a large, rapidly growing gap between current climate and the equilibrium climate for current atmospheric composition. Based on the climate sensitivity we have estimated, the amount of greenhouse gases presently in the atmosphere will cause an eventual global mean warming of about 1{\textdegree}C, making the global temperature at least comparable to that of the Altithermal, the warmest period in the past 100,000 years. Projection of future climate trends on the 10-100 year time scale depends crucially upon improved understanding of ocean dynamics, particularly upon how ocean mixing will respond to climate change at the ocean surface.},

abstract = {The precipitation that falls on the continents defines the extent and nature of terrestrial ecosystems and human activity in them, all of which are adapted to and maintained by present-day precipitation. In essence, precipitation is supplied by moisture that either comes directly from the ocean, or is subsequently recycled from the continents themselves. Both the processes that control evaporation and the main mechanisms of moisture transport clearly differ between the ocean and the continent, thus within the context of a changing climate, it may be expected that the relationship between precipitation of oceanic and terrestrial origin varies globally and regionally, as will the influence of these two basic components of total precipitation on global and regional precipitation trends, especially in tropical regions. We describe an approach based on a Lagrangian technique for estimating the precipitation in a target region given the proportions of moisture transported from the two sources (ocean and continent) to reveal that the percentage of precipitation of oceanic origin has increased globally in the current climate (1980–2016). The greatest observed rate of increase is in the tropical regions; furthermore, the trends of precipitation in these regions are controlled by trends in precipitation for which the source of moisture is the ocean.},

abstract = {Abstract The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission ended its operation in October 2017 and the GRACE Follow-On mission was launched only in May 2018, leading to approximately one year of data gap. Given that GRACE-type observations are exclusively providing direct estimates of Total Water Storage Change (TWSC), it would be very important to bridge the gap between these two missions. Furthermore, for many climate-related applications, it is also desirable to reconstruct TWSC prior to the GRACE period. In this study, we aim at comparing different data-driven methods and identifying the more robust alternatives for predicting GRACE-like gridded TWSC during the gap and reconstructing them to 1992 using climate inputs. To this end, we first develop a methodological framework to compare different methods such as the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and AutoRegressive eXogenous (ARX) approaches. Second, metrics are developed to measure the robustness of the predictions. Finally, gridded TWSC within twenty-six regions are predicted and reconstructed using the identified methods. Test computations suggest that the correlation of predicted TWSC maps with observed ones is more than 0.3 higher than TWSC simulated by hydrological models, at the grid scale of 1° resolution. Furthermore, the reconstructed TWSC correctly reproduce the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signals. In general, while MLR does not perform best in the training process, it is more robust and could thus be a viable approach both for filling the GRACE gap and for reconstructing long-period TWSC fields globally when combined with statistical decomposition techniques.},

In less well-studied areas there are opportunities to transfer concepts and knowledge from well-studied groundwater systems with the same or similar geological and geomorphic character. Conceptual models of groundwater behaviour that provide a landscape context for recharge/discharge make this possible.

Globally, riverine flood plains cover > 2 × 106km2, however, they are among the most threatened ecosystems. Floodplain degradation is closely linked to the rapid decline in freshwater biodiversity; the main reasons for the latter being habitat alteration, flow and flood control, species invasion and pollution. In Europe and North America, up to 90% of flood plains are already 'cultivated' and therefore functionally extinct. In the developing world, the remaining natural flood plains are disappearing at an accelerating rate, primarily as a result of changing hydrology. Up to the 2025 time horizon, the future increase of human population will lead to further degradation of riparian areas, intensification of the hydrological cycle, increase in the discharge of pollutants, and further proliferation of species invasions. In the near future, the most threatened flood plains will be those in south-east Asia, Sahelian Africa and North America. There is an urgent need to preserve existing, intact flood plain rivers as strategic global resources and to begin to restore hydrologic dynamics, sediment transport and riparian vegetation to those rivers that retain some level of ecological integrity. Otherwise, dramatic extinctions of aquatic and riparian species and of ecosystem services are faced within the next few decades.},

abstract = {The authors simulated the effects of Amazonian mesoscale deforestation in the boundary layer and in rainfall with the Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (BRAMS) model. They found that both the area and shape (with respect to wind incidence) of deforestation and the soil moisture status contributed to the state of the atmosphere during the time scale of several weeks, with distinguishable patterns of temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Deforestation resulted in the development of a three-dimensional thermal cell, the so-called deforestation breeze, slightly shifted downwind to large-scale circulation. The boundary layer was warmer and drier above 1000-m height and was slightly wetter up to 2000-m height. Soil wetness affected the circulation energetics proportionally to the soil dryness (for soil wetness below ∼0.6). The shape of the deforestation controlled the impact on rainfall. The horizontal strips lined up with the prevailing wind showed a dominant increase in rainfall, significant up to about 60 000 km 2. On the other hand, in the patches aligned in the opposite direction (north-south), there was both increase and decrease in precipitation in two distinct regions, as a result of clearly separated upward and downward branches, which caused the precipitation to increase for patches up to 15 000 km2The authors' estimates for the size of deforestation impacting the rainfall contributed to fill up the low spatial resolution in other previous studies.

abstract = {Satellite microwave radiometer data is affected by many degradation factors during the imaging process, such as the sampling interval, antenna pattern and scan mode, etc., leading to spatial resolution reduction. In this paper, a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to solve these degradation problems by learning the end-to-end mapping between low-and high-resolution images. Unlike traditional methods that handle each degradation factor separately, our network jointly learns both the sampling interval limitation and the comprehensive degeneration factors, including the antenna pattern, receiver sensitivity and scan mode, during the training process. Moreover, due to the powerful mapping capability of the deep residual CNN, our method achieves better resolution enhancement results both quantitatively and qualitatively than the methods in literature. The microwave radiation imager (MWRI) data from the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellite has been used to demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the method.},

abstract = {Study region: The Ganges-Brahmaputra (GB), a major river basin of the Indian Sub-Continent (ISC), is the host of more than 700 millions people. Study focus: In addition to monsoons and strong climate variability, GB is facing growing demands for freshwater availability by a continually growing population and rapidly developing of agricultural and industrial sectors. The management of water resources is thus of highest priority and, in the context of current over-abstraction of groundwater, accurate estimates of terrestrial freshwater storage are essential. We propose a multi-satellite approach to estimate surface freshwater storage (SWS) and subsurface water storage (SSWS, groundwater. +. soil moisture) variations over GB. New hydrological insights: Basin-scale monthly SWS variations for the period 2003-2007 show a mean annual amplitude of $\sim$410km3, contributing to about 45% of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived total water storage variations (TWS). During the drought-like conditions in 2006, we estimate that the SWS deficit over the entire GB basin in July-August-September was about 30% as compared to other years. The SWS variations are then used to decompose the GB GRACE-derived TWS and isolate the variations of SSWS whose mean annual amplitude is estimated to be $\sim$550km3. This new dataset of water storage variations represent an unprecedented source of information for hydrological and climate modeling studies of the ISC.},

The effects on the CRCM climate of model domain size, internal variability of the general circulation model (GCM) used to provide boundary conditions, and modifications to the physical parameterizations used in the CRCM are investigated. The influence of boundary conditions is further investigated by comparing the GCM-driven simulations of the current climate with simulations performed using boundary conditions from meteorological reanalyses. The present climate of the model in these different configurations is assessed by comparing the seasonal averages and interannual variability of precipitation and surface air temperature with an observed climatology. Generally, small differences are found between the two simulations on different domains, though both domains are quite large as compared with previously reported results. Simulations ...},

In this study we review existing implementations of soil moisture TC analysis as well as investigations of the assumptions underlying the method. Different notations that are used to formulate the TC problem are shown to be mathematically identical. While many studies have investigated issues related to possible violations of the underlying assumptions, only few TC modifications have been proposed to mitigate the impact of these violations. Moreover, assump-tions, which are often understood as a limitation that is unique to TC analysis are shown to be common also to other conventional performance metrics. Noteworthy advances in TC analysis have been made in the way error estimates are being presented by moving from the investigation of absolute error vari-ance estimates to the investigation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metrics. Here we review existing error presentations and propose the combined investigation of the SNR (expressed in logarithmic units), the unscaled error variances, and the soil moisture sensitivities of the data sets as an optimal strategy for the evaluation of remotely-sensed soil moisture data sets.},

abstract = { The southern Amazonia is undergoing a major biophysical transition, involving changes in land use and regional climate. This study provides new insights on the relationship between hydroclimatic variables and vegetation conditions in the upper Madeira Basin ($\sim$1 × 10 6 km 2 ). Vegetative dynamics are characterised using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) while hydroclimatic variability is analysed using satellite-based precipitation, observed river discharge, satellite measurements of terrestrial water storage (TWS) and downward shortwave radiation (DSR). We show that the vegetation in this region varies from energy-limited to water-limited throughout the year. During the peak of the wet season (January-February), rainfall, discharge and TWS are negatively correlated with NDVI in February-April ( r = −0.48 to −0.65; p < 0.05). In addition, DSR is positively correlated with NDVI ( r = 0.47–0.54; p < 0.05), suggesting that the vegetation is mainly energy-limited during this period. Outside this period, these correlations are positive for rainfall, discharge and TWS ( r = 0.55–0.88; p < 0.05), and negative for DSR ( r = −0.47 to −0.54; p < 0.05), suggesting that vegetation depends mainly on water availability, particularly during the vegetation dry season (VDS; late June to late October). Accordantly, the total rainfall during the dry season explains around 80% of the VDS NDVI interannual variance. Considering the predominant land cover types, differences in the hydroclimate-NDVI relationship are observed. Evergreen forests (531,350 km 2 ) remain energy-limited during the beginning of the dry season, but they become water-limited at the end of the VDS. In savannas and flooded savannas (162,850 km 2 ), water dependence occurs months before the onset of the VDS. These differences are more evident during extreme drought years (2007, 2010, and 2011), where regional impacts on NDVI were stronger in savannas and flooded savannas (55% of the entire surface of savannas) than in evergreen forests (40%). A spatial analysis reveals that two specific areas do not show significant hydroclimatic-NDVI correlations during the dry season: (i) the eastern flank of the Andes, characterised by very wet conditions, therefore the vegetation is not water-limited, and (ii) recent deforested areas ($\sim$42,500 km 2 ) that break the natural response in the hydroclimate-vegetation system. These findings are particularly relevant given the increasing rates of deforestation in this region. },

Here we use continuous multisatellite observations of inundation extent and water levels between 2003 and 2007 to monitor monthly variations of surface water storage at the basin scale. During the 2005 drought, the amount of water stored in the river and floodplains of the Amazon basin was ∼130 km3 (∼70%) below its 2003{\textendash}7 average.

Daily rainfall estimates are generated for an 18-year long period (1998-2015), with a spatial sampling of 0.25° on a global scale, and are based on the integration of the ACTIVE and the PASSIVE ESA CCI SM data sets.The quality of the SM2RAIN-CCI rainfall data set is evaluated by comparing it with two state-of-the-art rainfall satellite products, i.e. the Tropical Measurement Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42 real-time product (TMPA 3B42RT) and the Climate Prediction Center Morphing Technique (CMORPH), and one modeled data set (ERA-Interim). A quality check is carried out on a global scale at 1° of spatial sampling and 5 days of temporal sampling by comparing these products with the gauge-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre Full Data Daily (GPCC-FDD) product. SM2RAIN-CCI shows relatively good results in terms of correlation coefficient (median value > 0.56), root mean square difference (RMSD, median value < 10.34mm over 5 days) and bias (median value < 14.44%) during the evaluation period.

abstract = {Abstract Historically, conservation-oriented research and policy in Brazil have focused on Amazon deforestation, but a majority of Brazil's deforestation and agricultural expansion has occurred in the neighboring Cerrado biome, a biodiversity hotspot comprised of dry forests, woodland savannas, and grasslands. Resilience of rainfed agriculture in both biomes likely depends on water recycling in undisturbed Cerrado vegetation; yet little is known about how changes in land-use and land-cover affect regional climate feedbacks in the Cerrado. We used remote sensing techniques to map land-use change across the Cerrado from 2003 to 2013. During this period, cropland agriculture more than doubled in area from 1.2 to 2.5 million ha, with 74% of new croplands sourced from previously intact Cerrado vegetation. We find that these changes have decreased the amount of water recycled to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration (ET) each year. In 2013 alone, cropland areas recycled 14 km3 less (?3%) water than if the land cover had been native Cerrado vegetation. ET from single-cropping systems (e.g., soybeans) is less than from natural vegetation in all years, except in the months of January and February, the height of the growing season. In double-cropping systems (e.g., soybeans followed by corn), ET is similar to or greater than natural vegetation throughout a majority of the wet season (December?May). As intensification and extensification of agricultural production continue in the region, the impacts on the water cycle and opportunities for mitigation warrant consideration. For example, if an environmental goal is to minimize impacts on the water cycle, double cropping (intensification) might be emphasized over extensification to maintain a landscape that behaves more akin to the natural system.},

However, the data considered to represent the "true" values often include their own measurement errors, biasing calibration, and validation results. Triple collocation (TC) can be used to estimate the root-mean-square-error (RMSE), using observations from three mutually independent, error-prone measurement systems. Here, we introduce Extended Triple Collocation (ETC): using exactly the same assumptions as TC, we derive an additional performance metric, the correlation coefficient of the measurement system with respect to the unknown target, $\rho$<inf>t</inf>;X<inf>i</inf> . We demonstrate that $\rho$<inf>t</inf><sup>2</sup> ;X<inf>i</inf> is the scaled, unbiased signal-to-noise ratio and provides a complementary perspective compared to the RMSE. We apply it to three collocated wind data sets. Since ETC is as easy to implement as TC, requires no additional assumptions, and provides an extra performance metric, it may be of interest in a wide range of geophysical disciplines.},

abstract = {We developed a hierarchical dominant river tracing (DRT) algorithm for automated extraction and spatial upscaling of basin flow directions and river networks using fine-scale hydrography inputs (e.g., flow direction, river networks, and flow accumulation). In contrast with previous upscaling methods, the DRT algorithm utilizes information on global and local drainage patterns from baseline fine-scale hydrography to determine upscaled flow directions and other critical variables including upscaled basin area, basin shape, and river lengths. The DRT algorithm preserves the original baseline hierarchical drainage structure by tracing each entire flow path from headwater to river mouth at fine scale while prioritizing successively higher order basins and rivers for tracing. We applied the algorithm to produce a series of global hydrography data sets from 1/16� to 2� spatial scales in two geographic projections (WGS84 and Lambert azimuthal equal area). The DRT results were evaluated against other alternative upscaling methods and hydrography data sets for continental U.S. and global domains. These results show favorable DRT upscaling performance in preserving baseline fine-scale river network information including: (1) improved, automated extraction of flow directions and river networks at any spatial scale without the need for manual correction; (2) consistency of river network, basin shape, basin area, river length, and basin internal drainage structure between upscaled and baseline fine-scale hydrography; and (3) performance largely independent of spatial scale, geographic region, and projection. The results of this study include an initial set of DRT upscaled global hydrography maps derived from HYDRO1K baseline fine-scale hydrography inputs; these digital data are available online for public access at ftp://ftp.ntsg.umt.edu/pub/data/DRT/.},

abstract = {The fate of the terrestrial biosphere is highly uncertain given recent and projected changes in climate. This is especially acute for impacts associated with changes in drought frequency and intensity on the distribution and timing of water availability. The development of effective adaptation strategies for these emerging threats to food and water security are compromised by limitations in our understanding of how natural and managed ecosystems are responding to changing hydrological and climatological regimes. This information gap is exacerbated by insufficient monitoring capabilities from local to global scales. Here, we describe how evapotranspiration (ET) represents the key variable in linking ecosystem functioning, carbon and climate feedbacks, agricultural management, and water resources, and highlight both the outstanding science and applications questions and the actions, especially from a space-based perspective, necessary to advance them.},

abstract = {The complex interactions among climate variables in the Arctic have important implications for potential climate change, both globally and locally. Because the Arctic is a data-sparse region and because global climate models (GCMs) often represent Arctic climate variables poorly, significant uncertainties remain in our understanding of these processes. In addition to the traditional approach of validating individual variables with observed fields, we demonstrate that a comparison of covariances among interrelated parameters from observations and GCM output provides a tool to evaluate the realism of modeled relationships between variables. We analyze and compare a combination of conventional observations, satellite retrievals, and GCM simulations to examine some of these relationships. The three climate variables considered in this study are surface temperature, cloud cover, and downward longwave flux. Results show that the highest correlations between daily changes in pairs of variables for all three data sets occur between surface temperature and downward longwave flux, particularly in winter. There is less variability in GCM output, in part, because there is greater spatial averaging. Although the satellite products can be used to examine some of these relationships, additional work may be needed to ensure consistency between changes in radiative components of the energy budget and other retrieved quantities. The GCM's relationships between variables agree well with in situ observations, which provides some confidence that the GCM's representation of present-day climate is reasonable in high northern latitudes.},

Such a product can be beneficial in monitoring extreme weather events that last a few days and are missing by conventional monthly GRACE data. The determination of the distribution of these water mass sources over networks of juxtaposed triangular tiles was made using Kalman Filtering (KF) of daily GRACE geopotential difference observations that were reduced for isolating the continental hydrology contribution of the measured gravity field. Geopotential differences were obtained from the along-track K-Band Range Rate (KBRR) measurements according to the method of energy integral. The recovery approach was validated by inverting synthetic GRACE geopotential differences simulated using GLDAS/WGHM global hydrology model outputs. Series of daily regional and global KF solutions were estimated from real GRACE KBRR data for the period 2003–2012. They provide a realistic description of hydrological fluxes at monthly time scales, which are consistent with classical spherical harmonics and mascons solutions provided by the GRACE official centers but also give an intra-month/daily continuity of these variations.</p>},

abstract = {Satellite-based precipitation products are promising data sources for the hydrometeorological community. However, many of these products lack quantitative estimates of their uncertainty. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation study of the state-of-the-art satellite-based precipitation product: Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) research product (TRMM 3B42) in the middle and upper reaches of Heihe River Basin. The study area locates in arid and semiarid regions in the northwest of China. Both version 6 (V6) and the newly released version 7 (V7) TRMM 3B42 research products are evaluated through statistical analysis and hydrological modeling in this study. We find that the performance of daily TMPA products is climatology-dependent. For the study basin, TMPA products generally perform better in wetter than in drier climatology conditions. High False Alarming Ratio (FAR) and positive bias occur in drier areas, whereas TMPA products display negative bias in wetter regions. TMPA products perform worse in winter when snowfall occurs than in nonsnow seasons. The new V7 TMPA products perform better than V6 on both daily and monthly scales. Hydrological modeling results show that TMPA products are promising in streamflow simulation at ungauged basins in arid and semiarid regions, especially the new V7 whose integrated performance is comparable with that of gauge-based precipitation estimate. When model parameters' sensitivity in forcing precipitation is considered by model recalibration, performances of both two versions of TMPA products are improved, especially for the peak flow simulation in summer. This study can serve as a reference of uncertainty estimates of the TMPA research time precipitation products in hydrometeorological applications at a watershed scale.},

abstract = {Amazon tropical forests and the semiarid Northeast Brazil (NEB) region have registered very severe droughts during the last two decades, with a frequency that may have exceeded natural climate variability. Severe droughts impact the physiological response of Amazon forests, decreasing the availability to absorb atmospheric CO2, as well as biodiversity and increasing risk of fires. Droughts on this region also affect population by isolating them due to anomalous low river levels. Impacts of droughts over NEB region are related to water and energy security and subsistence agriculture. Most drought episodes over Amazonia and NEB are associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o (EN) events, anomalous warming over the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), and even an overlapping among them. However, not all the dry episodes showed a large-scale pattern linked to a canonical EN event or warm TNA episodes. For instance, dry episodes linked to EN events present distinct spatial patterns of precipitation anomalies depending on EN type (Central-Pacific vs. Eastern-Pacific EN), and NEB region experienced a severe drought in 2012 that is not attributed to EN or warm TNA events. Even in the case of the strong EN in 2015/16, some regional impacts have not been explained by EN contribution. This paper discusses the effects of CP and EP EN events, and the role of warm TNA events on tropical Walker and Hadley circulation leading to drought over Amazonia and NEB regions.},

abstract = {A remote measurement of the atmosphere with high spectral resolution form the ground or from space, such as might be made form one of the new generation of instruments such as the Fourier transform or grating spectrometers AIRS, MIPAS, TES, or IASI, would appear to contain a large amount of information about the atmosphere, but it is not immediately obvious how to quantify it or to use it efficiently or effectively. The usefulness of a particular remote measurement can be described by a wide range of parameters including the spatial resolution, precision and accuracy of the retrieved product. For optimization of a measurement method, however, a single scalar figure of merit is required, whereas all of the above are vectors because they are functions of altitude and/or quantity retrieved. Spatial averages of resolution, precision and accuracy could be used, but there are two quantities of general applicability which can be defined without reference to the specific retrieval method, and are therefore more straightforward in use. These are the information content, and the number of degrees of freedom for signal, the latter being a measure of the number of statistically independent quantities in any one measurement. It can be shown that both of these quantities are functions of the eigenvalues of a certain matrix, and are closely related. The information content and the degrees of freedom provide single parameters which can be used in the automated optimization of for example, instrument design parameters, the selection of microwindows or subsets of channels for retrieval, the optimization of retrieval strategy, and the understanding of the information content of a spectrum. Some such applications are illustrated by means of simulated spectra for the AIRS instrument.},

abstract = {Current global river routing models do not represent floodplain inundation dynamics realistically because the storage and movement of surface waters are regulated by small-scale topography rather than the commonly used spatial resolution of global models. In this study, we propose a new global river routing model, CaMa-Flood, which explicitly parameterizes the subgrid-scale topography of a floodplain, thus describing floodplain inundation dynamics. The relationship between water storage, water level, and flooded area in the model is decided on the basis of the subgrid-scale topographic parameters based on 1 km resolution digital elevation model. Horizontal water transport is calculated with a diffusive wave equation, which realizes the backwater effect in flat river basins. A set of global-scale river flow simulations demonstrated an improved predictability of daily-scale river discharge in many major world rivers by incorporating the floodplain inundation dynamics. Detailed analysis of the simulated results for the Amazon River suggested that introduction of the diffusive wave equation is essential for simulating water surface elevation realistically. The simulated spatiotemporal variation of the flooded area in the Amazon basin showed a good correlation with satellite observations, especially when the backwater effect was considered. The improved predictability for daily river discharge, water surface elevation, and inundated areas by the proposed model will promote climate system studies and water resource assessments.

abstract = {Large dams built for hydroelectric power generation alter the hydrology of rivers, attenuating the flood pulse downstream of the dam and impacting riparian and floodplain ecosystems. The present work mapped black-water floodplain forests (igap{\'{o}}) downstream of the Balbina Reservoir, which was created between 1983 and 1987 by damming the Uatum{\~{a}} River in the Central Amazon basin. We apply remote sensing methods to detect tree mortality resulting from hydrological changes, based on analysis of 56 ALOS/PALSAR synthetic aperture radar images acquired at different flood levels between 2006 and 2011. Our application of object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods and the random forests supervised classification algorithm yielded an overall accuracy of 87.2%. A total of 9800 km 2 of igap{\'{o}} forests were mapped along the entire river downstream of the dam, but forest mortality was only observed below the first 49 km downstream, after the Morena rapids, along an 80-km river stretch. In total, 12% of the floodplain forest died within this stretch. We also detected that 29% of the remaining living igap{\'{o}} forest may be presently undergoing mortality. Furthermore, this large loss does not include the entirety of lost igap{\'{o}} forests downstream of the dam; areas which are now above current maximum flooding heights are no longer floodable and do not show on our mapping but will likely transition over time to upland forest species composition and dynamics, also characteristic of igap{\'{o}} loss. Our results show that floodplain forests are extremely sensitive to long-term downstream hydrological changes and disturbances resulting from the disruption of the natural flood pulse. Brazilian hydropower regulations should require that Amazon dam operations ensure the simulation of the natural flood-pulse, despite losses in energy production, to preserve the integrity of floodplain forest ecosystems and to mitigate impacts for the riverine populations.},

However, regular gauging networks fail to provide the information needed for spatial coverage and timely delivery. Although the space missions discussed here were not primarily dedicated to hydrology, 18 years of satellite altimetry have furnished complementary data that can be used to create hydrological products, such as time series of stages, estimated discharges of rivers or volume change of lakes, river altitude profiles or leveling of in situ stations. Raw data still suffer uncertainties of one to several decimeters. These require specific reprocessing such as waveform retracking or geophysical correction editing; much work still remains to be done. Besides, measuring the flow velocity appears feasible owing to SAR interferometer techniques. Inundated surfaces, and the time variations of their extent, are currently almost routinely computed using satellite imagery. Thus, the compilation of the continuous efforts of the scientific community in these various investigative directions, such as recording from space the discharges of rivers or the change in water volume stored in lakes, can be foreseen in the near future. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

We examined projections of climate change on discharge and inundation extent in the Amazon basin using the regional hydrological model MGB-IPH with 1-dimensional river hydraulic and water storage simulation in floodplains. Future projections (2070–2099) were obtained from five GCMs from IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report CMIP5. Climate projections have uncertainty and results from different climate models did not agree in total Amazon flooded area or discharge anomalies along the main stem river. Overall, model runs agree better with wetter (drier) conditions over western (eastern) Amazon. Results indicate that increased mean and maximum river discharge for large rivers draining the Andes in the northwest contributes to increased mean and maximum discharge and inundation extent over Peruvian floodplains and Solim{\~{o}}es River (annual mean-max: +9 % - +18.3 %) in western Amazonia. Decreased river discharges (mostly dry season) are projected for eastern basins, and decreased inundation extent at low water (annual min) in the central (−15.9 %) and lower Amazon (−4.4 %).},

abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is difficult to measure at the scales of climate models and climate variability. While satellite retrieval algorithms do exist, their accuracy is limited by the sparseness of in situ observations available for calibration and validation, which themselves may be unrepresentative of 500m and larger scale satellite footprints and grid pixels. Here, we use a combination of satellite and ground-based observations to close the water budgets of seven continental scale river basins (Mackenzie, Fraser, Nelson, Mississippi, Tocantins, Danube, and Ubangi), estimating mean ET as a residual. For any river basin, ET must equal total precipitation minus net runoff minus the change in total terrestrial water storage (TWS), in order for mass to be conserved. We make use of precipitation from two global observation-based products, archived runoff data, and TWS changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. We demonstrate that while uncertainty in the water budget-based estimates of monthly ET is often too large for those estimates to be useful, the uncertainty in the mean annual cycle is small enough that it is practical for evaluating other ET products. Here, we evaluate five land surface model simulations, two operational atmospheric analyses, and a recent global reanalysis product based on our results. An important outcome is that the water budget-based ET time series in two tropical river basins, one in Brazil and the other in central Africa, exhibit a weak annual cycle, which may help to resolve debate about the strength of the annual cycle of ET in such regions and how ET is constrained throughout the year. The methods described will be useful for water and energy budget studies, weather and climate model assessments, and satellite-based ET retrieval optimization.

abstract = {[1] We present a European land-only daily high-resolution gridded data set for precipitation and minimum, maximum, and mean surface temperature for the period 1950–2006. This data set improves on previous products in its spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations, and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with return periods up to 10 years.},

abstract = {Regions with high productivity of agriculture, such as the Beqaa Plain, Lebanon, often rely on groundwater supplies for irrigation demand. Recent reports have indicated that groundwater consumption in this region has been unsustainable, and quantifying rates of groundwater depletion has remained a challenge. Here, we utilize 15 years of data (June 2002–April 2017) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission to show Total Water Storage (TWS) changes in Lebanon's Beqaa Plain. We then obtain complimentary information on various hydrologic cycle variables, such as soil moisture storage, snow water equivalent, and canopy water storage from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model, and surface water data from the largest body of water in this region, the Qaraaoun Reservoir, to disentangle the TWS signal and calculate groundwater storage changes. After combining the information from the remaining hydrologic cycle variables, we determine that the majority of the losses in TWS are due to groundwater depletion in the Beqaa Plain. Results show that the rate of groundwater storage change in the West Beqaa is nearly +0.08 cm/year, in the Rashaya District is −0.01 cm/year, and in the Zahle District the level of depletion is roughly −1.10 cm/year. Results are confirmed using Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, which provide high-precision measurements of land subsidence changes caused by intense groundwater usage. Furthermore, data from local monitoring wells are utilized to further showcase the significant drop in groundwater level that is occurring through much of the region. For monitoring groundwater storage changes, our recommendation is to combine various data sources, and in areas where groundwater measurements are lacking, we especially recommend the use of data from remote sensing.},

abstract = {The large-scale observations of terrestrial water storage from GRACE satellites over the Amazon are analyzed with land surface model (LSM) outputs of runoff and soil moisture. A simple yet effective runoff routing method based on a continuity equation is implemented to model horizontal transport of surface water within the Amazon basin. The GRACE observations are analyzed separately for soil moisture and surface water storages (generated from runoff), relying on their distinct spatial patterns, being disperse for soil moisture and localized for surface water. Various effective velocities for storage transport are tested against the GRACE observations. When the model runoff is routed with an uniform velocity of 30 cm/s, the annual variation of the resulting surface water storage is generally found to be larger than the satellite measurements and ground gauge data by a factor of 1.5 or higher. The peak annual anomaly of surface water storage is observed around the midstream of the Amazon main stem. However, the runoff routing simulations present the peak amplitude consistently around the delta (downstream), unless the increasing velocity in a downstream region is used. As complements to the ground gauge data, the satellite observations provide unique spatial information of water cycle parameters. Our analysis indicates possible shortcomings in the certain LSM mass transport scheme between atmosphere and land surface, particularly the production of too large seasonal variations in runoff (and maybe too little variations in evapotranspiration), and the dynamic characteristics of surface water transport within the Amazon basins.

abstract = {A new sequential data assimilation method is discussed. it is based on forecasting the error statistics using Monte Carlo methods, a better alternative than solving the traditional and computationally extremely demanding approximate error covariance equation used in the extended Kalman filter. The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. -from Author},

abstract = {Tropical rainforest regions have large hydropower generation potential that figures prominently in many nations' energy growth strategies. Feasibility studies of hydropower plants typically ignore the effect of future deforestation or assume that deforestation will have a positive effect on river discharge and energy generation resulting from declines in evapotranspiration (ET) associated with forest conversion. Forest loss can also reduce river discharge, however, by inhibiting rainfall. We used land use, hydrological, and climate models to examine the local "direct" effects (through changes in ET within the watershed) and the potential regional "indirect" effects (through changes in rainfall) of deforestation on river discharge and energy generation potential for the Belo Monte energy complex, one of the world's largest hydropower plants that is currently under construction on the Xingu River in the eastern Amazon. In the absence of indirect effects of deforestation, simulated deforestation of 20% and 40% within the Xingu River basin increased discharge by 4-8% and 10-12%, with similar increases in energy generation. When indirect effects were considered, deforestation of the Amazon region inhibited rainfall within the Xingu Basin, counterbalancing declines in ET and decreasing discharge by 6-36%. Under business-as-usual projections of forest loss for 2050 (40%), simulated power generation declined to only 25% of maximum plant output and 60% of the industry's own projections. Like other energy sources, hydropower plants present large social and environmental costs. Their reliability as energy sources, however, must take into account their dependence on forests.},

abstract = {In this study, the trends and variability of annual precipitation totals and annual rain days over land within the Mediterranean region are analyzed. Long term ground-based observations concerning, on one hand, monthly precipitation totals (1900–2010) and rain days (1965–2010) from 40 meteorological stations within the Mediterranean region were obtained from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service and the World Climate Data and Monitoring Programme (WCDMP) of the World Meteorological Organization. On the other hand, high spatial resolution (0.5° × 0.5°) gridded monthly data CRU TS 3.1 were acquired from the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia, for the period 1901–2009. The two datasets were compared by means of trends and variability, while the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the Mediterranean precipitation was examined. In the process, the climatic changes in the precipitation regime between the period 1961–1990 (reference period) and the period 2071–2100 (future climate) were presented using climate model simulations (RACMO2.1/KNMI). The future climate projections were based on SRES A1B.  The findings of the analysis showed that statistically significant (95% confidence level) negative trends of the annual precipitation totals exist in the majority of Mediterranean regions during the period 1901–2009, with an exception of northern Africa, southern Italy and western Iberian peninsula, where slight positive trends (not statistically significant at 95% CL) appear. Concerning the annual number of rain days, a pronounced decrease of 20 %, statistically significant (95% confidence level), appears in representative meteorological stations of east Mediterranean, while the trends are insignificant for west and central Mediterranean. Additionally, NAO index was found to be anticorrelated with the precipitation totals and the number of rain days mainly in Spain, southern France, Italy and Greece. These correlations are higher within the rain season (October–March) than the entire year. Based on the results of regional climate model RACMO2.1/KNMI, precipitation is very likely to decrease almost 20% in the period 2071–2100 compared to 1961–1990, under SRES A1B.},

This study aims to evaluate the water budget of the Amazon basin based on several state-ofthe- art land surface model (LSM) outputs. Water budget variables (terrestrial water storage TWS, evapotranspiration ET, surface runoff R, and base flow B) are evaluated at the basin scale using both remote sensing and in situ data. Meteorological forcings at a 3-hourly time step and 18 spatial resolution were used to run 14 LSMs. Precipitation datasets that have been rescaled to matchmonthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) andGlobal Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) datasets and the daily Hydrologie du Bassin de l'Amazone (HYBAM) dataset were used to perform three experiments. The Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP) river routing scheme was forced with R and B and simulated discharges are compared against observations at 165 gauges. Simulated ET and TWS are compared against FLUXNET and MOD16A2 evapotranspiration datasets andGravity Recovery and ClimateExperiment (GRACE)TWSestimates in two subcatchments of main tributaries (Madeira and Negro Rivers).At the basin scale, simulated ET ranges from 2.39 to 3.26mmday-1 and a low spatial correlation between ET and precipitation indicates that evapotranspiration does not depend on water availability over most of the basin. Results also show that other simulated water budget components vary significantly as a function of both the LSM and precipitation dataset, but simulated TWS generally agrees with GRACE estimates at the basin scale. The best water budget simulations resulted from experiments using HYBAM, mostly explained by a denser rainfall gauge network and the rescaling at a finer temporal scale.},

abstract = {Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is a key element in the global and continental water cycle. Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has provided a highly valuable dataset, which allows the study of TWS over larger river basins worldwide. However, the lifetime of GRACE is too short to demonstrate long-term variability in TWS. In the Beishan area of northwestern China, which is selected as the most prospective site for high-level radioactive waste (HLRW) disposal, the assessment of long-term TWS changes is crucial to understand disposal safety. Monthly and annual TWS changes during the past 35 years are reconstructed using GRACE data, other remote sensing products, and the water balance method. Hydrological flux outputs from multisource remote sensing products are analyzed and compared to select appropriate data sources. The results show that a decreasing trend is found for GRACE-filtered and Center for Space Research (CSR) mascon solutions from 2003 to 2015, with slopes of −2.30 ± 0.52 and −1.52 ± 0.24 mm/year, respectively. TWS variations independently computed from the water balance method also show a similar decreasing trend with the GRACE observations, with a slope of −0.94 mm/year over the same period. Overall, the TWS anomalies in the Beishan area change seasonally within 10 mm and have been decreasing since 1980, keeping a desirable dry condition as a HLRW disposal site.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a Projected Principal Component Analysis (Projected-PCA), which is based on the projection of the data matrix onto a given linear space before performing the principal component analysis. When it applies to high-dimensional factor analysis, the projection removes idiosyncratic noisy components. We show that the unobserved latent factors can be more accurately estimated than the conventional PCA if the projection is genuine, or more precisely the factor loading matrices are related to the projected linear space, and that they can be estimated accurately when the dimensionality is large, even when the sample size is finite. In an effort to more accurately estimating factor loadings, we propose a flexible semi-parametric factor model, which decomposes the factor loading matrix into the component that can be explained by subject-specific covariates and the orthogonal residual component. The covariates effect on the factor loadings are further modeled by the additive model via sieve approximations. By using the newly proposed Projected-PCA, the rates of convergence of the smooth factor loading matrices are obtained, which are much faster than those of the conventional factor analysis. The convergence is achieved even when the sample size is finite and is particularly appealing in the high-dimension-low-sample-size situation. This leads us to developing nonparametric tests on whether observed covariates have explaining powers on the loadings and whether they fully explain the loadings. Finally, the proposed method is illustrated by both simulated data and the returns of the components of the S\{\&}P 500 index.},

abstract = {A suite of climate change indices derived from daily temperature and precipitation data, with a primary focus on extreme events, were computed and analyzed. By setting an exact formula for each index and using specially designed software, analyses done in different countries have been combined seamlessly. This has enabled the presentation of the most up-to-date and comprehensive global picture of trends in extreme temperature and precipitation indices using results from a number of workshops held in data-sparse regions and high-quality station data supplied by numerous scientists world wide. Seasonal and annual indices for the period 1951-2003 were gridded. Trends in the gridded fields were computed and tested for statistical significance. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature. Over 70% of the global land area sampled showed a significant decrease in the annual occurrence of cold nights and a significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm nights. Some regions experienced a more than doubling of these indices. This implies a positive shift in the distribution of daily minimum temperature throughout the globe. Daily maximum temperature indices showed similar changes but with smaller magnitudes. Precipitation changes showed a widespread and significant increase, but the changes are much less spatially coherent compared with temperature change. Probability distributions of indices derived from approximately 200 temperature and 600 precipitation stations, with near-complete data for 1901-2003 and covering a very large region of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (and parts of Australia for precipitation) were analyzed for the periods 1901-1950, 1951-1978 and 1979-2003. Results indicate a significant warming throughout the 20th century. Differences in temperature indices distributions are particularly pronounced between the most recent two periods and for those indices related to minimum temperature. An analysis of those indices for which seasonal time series are available shows that these changes occur for all seasons although they are generally least pronounced for September to November. Precipitation indices show a tendency toward wetter conditions throughout the 20th century.},

abstract = {In the tropical Andes, the identification of the present synoptic mechanisms associated with the diurnal cycle of precipitation and its interaction with orography is a key step to understand how the atmospheric circulation influences the patterns of precipitation variability on longer time-scales. In particular we aim to better understand the combination of the local and regional mechanisms controlling the diurnal cycle of summertime (DJF) precipitation in the Northern Central Andes (NCA) region of Southern Peru. A climatology of the diurnal cycle is obtained from 15 wet seasons (2000–2014) of 3-hourly TRMM-3B42 data (0.25° × 0.25°) and swath data from the TRMM-2A25 precipitation radar product (5 km × 5 km). The main findings are: (1) in the NCA region, the diurnal cycle shows a maximum precipitation occurring during the day (night) in the western (eastern) side of the Andes highlands, (2) in the valleys of the Cuzco region and in the Amazon slope of the Andes the maximum (minimum) precipitation occurs during the night (day). The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) regional atmospheric model is used to simulate the mean diurnal cycle in the NCA region for the same period at 27 km and 9 km horizontal grid spacing and 3-hourly output, and at 3 km only for the month of January 2010 in the Cuzco valleys. Sensitivity experiments were also performed to investigate the effect of the topography on the observed rainfall patterns. The model reproduces the main diurnal precipitation features. The main atmospheric processes identified are: (1) the presence of a regional-scale cyclonic circulation strengthening during the afternoon, (2) diurnal thermally driven circulations at local scale, including upslope (downslope) wind and moisture transport during the day (night), (3) channelization of the upslope moisture transport from the Amazon along the Apurimac valleys toward the western part of the cordillera.},

abstract = {Continental-scale flood discharge modeling requires a high level of efficiency and flexibility. To this end, this study documents the implementation and application of a vector-based river routing model in the community WRF-Hydro modeling framework. Using Hurricane Ike as a case study, the hybrid vector–grid modeling framework's sensitivity to the land grid resolution and the coupling interface is assessed. Results show the model is more sensitive to the coupling interface than the grid resolution, and a 1-km land grid with an area-weighted coupling interface exhibits the optimal simulation results. A geographic information system (GIS) based approach is adopted to improve the regional representativeness of the flow travel time estimation. The model's computational efficiency and complexity are compared to a grid-based routing scheme, demonstrating its advantages for large-scale “offline” hydrological applications with GIS-supported features. Trade-offs between the modeling efficiency and complexity are then discussed to inform future large-scale flood prediction applications.},

abstract = {Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data are used to indicate mechanisms responsible for extreme summer convection over South America. The three-dimensional reflectivity field is analyzed to define three types of extreme echo, deep convective cores, wide convective cores, and broad stratiform regions. The location and timing of these echoes are sensitive to midlatitude synoptic disturbances crossing the Andes. At the leading edges of these disturbances the nocturnal South American low-level jet (SALLJ) transports moisture along the eastern edge of the Andes from the tropical to the subtropical part of the continent. Where the SALLJ rises over lower but steep mountains on the east side of the southern central Andes, deep and wide convective cores are triggered in the evening. When the SALLJ withdraws to the north as the disturbance passes, nocturnal triggering occurs in the northeastern foothills of the central Andes. Extreme convection over the Amazon basin takes the form of broad stratiform regions that evolve from systems with wide convective cores moving into the center of the region from both the southwest and northeast. The systems from the northeast form at the northeast coast and are likely squall lines. Along the coast of the Brazilian Highlands, diurnal/topographic forcing leads to daytime maxima of deep convective cores followed a few hours later by wide convective cores. Wide convective cores and broad stratiform regions form in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) with a diurnal cycle related to continental heating. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

Overall catches increased rapidly to their maximum levels by the late 1980s and then declined and remained rather stable at around 75% of their highest levels. The mean trophic level of the catches followed a similar pattern to the overall catches with constant (except for 2005-2007) but steady decline since the late 1980s. The annual catches of 2636 stocks were also analysed for the period 1970-2010 and classified into exploitation categories according to the catch-based method of stock classification. In 2010, about 22% of the stocks were depleted, 40% were overexploited, 24% were fully exploited while undeveloped/developing fisheries were confined to 14%. All analyses indicate that the Mediterranean and Black Sea fisheries are gradually contracting to unsustainable levels. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The transport of freshwater from continents to oceans through rivers has traditionally been estimated by routing runoff from land surface models within river models to obtain discharge. This paradigm imposes that errors are transferred from runoff to discharge, yet the analytical propagation of uncertainty from runoff to discharge has never been derived. Here we apply statistics to the continuity equation within a river network to derive two equations that propagate the mean and variance/covariance of runoff errors independently. We validate these equations in a case study of the rivers in the western United States and, for the first time, invert observed discharge errors for spatially distributed runoff errors. Our results suggest that the largest discharge error source is the joint variability of runoff errors across space, not the mean or amplitude of individual errors. Our findings significantly advance the science of error quantification in model-based estimates of river discharge.},

abstract = {Soil moisture is a key participant in land-atmosphere interactions and an important determinant of terrestrial climate. In regions where the water table is shallow, soil moisture is coupled to the water table. This paper is the first of a two-part study to quantify this coupling and explore its implications in the context of climate modeling. We examine the observed water table depth in the lower 48 states of the United States in search of salient spatial and temporal features that are relevant to climate dynamics. As a means to interpolate and synthesize the scattered observations, we use a simple two-dimensional groundwater flow model to construct an equilibrium water table as a result of long-term climatic and geologic forcing. Model simulations suggest that the water table depth exhibits spatial organization at watershed, regional, and continental scales, which may have implications for the spatial organization of soil moisture at similar scales. The observations suggest that water table depth varies at diurnal, event, seasonal, and interannual scales, which may have implications for soil moisture memory at these scales.

abstract = {Terrestrial water storage (TWS) composed of surface waters, soil moisture, groundwater and snow where appropriate, is a key element of global and continental water cycle. Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) space gravimetry mission provides a new tool to measure large-scale TWS variations. However, for the past few decades, direct estimate of TWS variability is accessible from hydrological modeling only. Here we propose a novel approach that combines GRACE-based TWS spatial patterns with multi-decadal-long in situ river level records, to reconstruct past 2-D TWS over a river basin. Results are presented for the Amazon Basin for the period 1980-2008, focusing on the interannual time scale. Results are compared with past TWS estimated by the global hydrological model ISBA-TRIP. Correlations between reconstructed past interannual TWS variability and known climate forcing modes over the region (e.g., El Ni±o-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) are also estimated. This method offers new perspective for improving our knowledge of past interannual TWS in world river basins where natural climate variability (as opposed to direct anthropogenic forcing) drives TWS variations. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2011.},

abstract = {During the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), METEOSAT-5 positioned at 63°E provided observation of the visible and infrared radiance field over the Indian Ocean. A cloud classification process using the dynamic cluster method is applied to these data. For the 3 months of the experiment (January-March 1999), daily maps of the cloud cover type are built for 0730 and 0900 UTC. The occurrence frequency of clear sky, low-and high-level cloud cover is examined. These frequencies are compared to the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program (ISCCP) D1 data set for the period 1984 to 1994. The Indian Ocean region can be classified in three zones. In the north subtropics, clear sky and small cumulus occur at least 90% of the time. Near the coast of India, clear sky is as frequent as 80 to 100%. The Intertropical Convergence Zone, characterized by the occurrence frequency of high-level clouds greater than 30%, spreads from Indonesia to North Madagascar. Near Indonesia, high-level cloud cover occurs more than 55% of the time. In the south subtropics, low cloud cover is the most frequent. In the eastern part the occurrence frequency reaches 80%. This percentage decreases along the western side of the ocean where low clouds break up. Between the African coast and Madagascar, high-level clouds are frequent. The mean spatial features found are in agreement with the ISCCP climatology, except for the eastern part of the south subtropics. A regional comparison shows the difficulty of making the analysis of interannual variations of cloud cover obtained from various cloud cover retrievals applied to different satellite data sets. This difficulty arises from the nonneglectable percentage of satellite pixels which can contain some very small low clouds. Copyright 2001 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The hydrological effects of forest cover loss are difficult to discern in the case of large-scale basins with gradual changes and difficult to isolate when climate variability is also present. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of climate variability and human activity on the annual streamflow in a basin in the Amazon arc of deforestation. We statistically analyzed the components of the annual water balance and monthly streamflow and used the currently used Tomer-Schilling, elasticity, and decomposition of Budyko-type curve methods to separate climate-induced changes and anthropogenic effects. Annual series of the monthly maximum and minimum streamflow, total streamflow, and total reference evapotranspiration presented statistically significant increasing trends. No significant trend was observed for precipitation. The greatest change in the average annual runoff coefficient was observed between the first (1973–1984) and second (1985–1994) analyzed periods. Even with the continuous reduction in the forested area, the third (1994–2004) and fourth analyzed periods (2003–2016) showed only relatively small changes, most likely due to the intensity of slash-and-burn activities and vegetation regrowth. The methods showed that deforestation was the primary cause of the streamflow changes, but with different intensities, and a small recuperation was observed in the last analyzed period. On average, the annual water yield would increase between 26% and 58% after the first time interval without the opposite effect of climate variability, which must be considered in basin management. Future research should focus on analyzing the water storage and the dependence of the precipitation-runoff relationship from the climate.},

We find that (1) the model simulates the basin-averaged TWS variations remarkably well; however, disagreements are observed in spatial patterns of temporal trends, especially for the post-2008 period. (2) The 2010s is the driest period since 1980, characterized by a major shift in the decadal mean compared to the 2000s caused by increased drought frequency. (3) Long-term trends in TWS suggest that the Amazon overall is getting wetter (1.13 mm yr-1), but its southern and southeastern sub-basins are undergoing significant negative TWS changes, caused primarily by intensified LULC changes. (4) Increasing divergence between dry-season total water deficit and TWS release suggests a strengthening dry season, especially in the southern and southeastern sub-basins. (5) The sub-surface storage regulates the propagation of meteorological droughts into hydrological droughts by strongly modulating TWS release with respect to its storage preceding the drought condition. Our simulations provide crucial insight into the importance of sub-surface storage in alleviating surface water deficit across Amazon and open pathways for improving prediction and mitigation of extreme droughts under changing climate and increasing hydrologic alterations due to human activities (e.g., LULC change).},

abstract = {Rainfall variability in the Amazon basin is studied in relation to sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) in the equatorial Pacific and the northern and southern tropical Atlantic during the 1977-99 period, using the HiBAm original rainfall data set and complementary cluster and composite analyses. The northeastern part of the basin, north of 5°S and east of 60°W, is significantly related with tropical SSTs: a rainier wet season is observed when the equatorial Pacific and the northern (southern) tropical Atlantic are anomalously cold (warm). A shorter and drier wet season is observed during El Ni{\~{n}}o events and negative rainfall anomalies are also significantly associated with a warm northern Atlantic in the austral autumn and a cold southern Atlantic in the spring. The northeastern Amazon rainfall anomalies are closely related with El Ni{\~{n}}o-southern oscillation during the whole year, whereas the relationships with the tropical Atlantic SST anomalies are mainly observed during the autumn. A time-space continuity is observed between El Ni{\~{n}}o-related rainfall anomalies in the northeastern Amazon, those in the northern Amazon and south-eastern Amazon, and those in northern South America and in the Nordeste of Brazil. A reinforcement of certain rainfall anomalies is observed when specific oceanic events combine. For instance, when El Ni{\~{n}}o and cold SSTs in the southern Atlantic are associated, very strong negative anomalies are observed in the whole northern Amazon basin. Nonetheless, the comparison of the cluster and the composite analyses results shows that the rainfall anomalies in the northeastern Amazon are not always associated with tropical SST anomalies. In the southern and western Amazon, significant tropical SST-related rainfall anomalies are very few and spatially variable. The precipitation origins differ from those of the northeastern Amazon: land temperature variability, extratropical perturbations and moisture advection are important rainfall factors, as well as SSTs. This could partially explain why: (a) the above-mentioned signals weaken or disappear, with the exception of the relative dryness that is observed at the peak of an El Ni{\~{n}}o event and during the dry season when northern Atlantic SSTs are warmer than usual; (b) rainfall anomalies tend to resemble those of southeastern South America, noticeably at the beginning and the end of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events; (c) some strong excesses of rain are not associated with any SST anomalies and merit further investigation. {\textcopyright}2002 Royal Meteorological Society.},

The Andes form a barrier at the western end of the basin and, coupled with the prevailing easterly winds, ensure an almost unique precipitation and water-recycling regime. On average 50 percent of the precipitation is recycled, and in some areas even more. The soils are poor. Most of the nitrogen and phosphorus is found in the soil, and the remaining nutrient elements are found in the standing biomass. There is some nutrient recycling and little loss from the intact ecosystem, and the small input of nutrients from precipitation maintains a small positive nutrient balance. Continued large-scale deforestation is likely to lead to increased erosion and water runoff with initial flooding in the lower Amazon, together with reduced evapotranspiration and ultimately reduced precipitation. Reduced precipitation in the Amazon could increase the tendency toward continentality and adversely affect climate and the present agriculture in south-central Brazil.},

abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> During the 1970s and 1980s, West Africa has faced extreme climate variations with extended drought conditions. Of particular importance is the Niger basin, since it traverses a large part of the Sahel and is thus a critical source of water for an ever-increasing local population in this semi arid region. However, the understanding of the hydrological processes over this basin is currently limited by the lack of spatially distributed surface water and discharge measurements. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of the ISBA-TRIP continental hydrologic system to represent key processes related to the hydrological cycle of the Niger basin. ISBA-TRIP is currently used within a coupled global climate model, so that the scheme must represent the first order processes which are critical for representing the water cycle while retaining a limited number of parameters and a simple representation of the physics. To this end, the scheme uses first-order approximations to account explicitly for the surface river routing, the floodplain dynamics, and the water storage using a deep aquifer reservoir. In the current study, simulations are done at a 0.5 by 0.5° spatial resolution over the 2002–2007 period (in order to take advantage of the recent satellite record and data from the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses project, AMMA). Four configurations of the model are compared to evaluate the separate impacts of the flooding scheme and the aquifer on the water cycle. Moreover, the model is forced by two different rainfall datasets to consider the sensitivity of the model to rainfall input uncertainties. The model is evaluated using in situ discharge measurements as well as satellite derived flood extent, total continental water storage changes and river height changes. The basic analysis of in situ discharges confirms the impact of the inner delta area, known as a significant flooded area, on the discharge, characterized by a strong reduction of the streamflow after the delta compared to the streamflow before the delta. In the simulations, the flooding scheme leads to a non-negligible increase of evaporation over large flooded areas, which decreases the Niger river flow by 15% to 50% in the locations situated after the inner delta as a function of the input rainfall dataset used as forcing. This improves the simulation of the river discharge downstream of the delta, confirming the need for coupling the land surface scheme with the flood model. The deep aquifer reservoir improves Niger low flows and the recession law during the dry season. The comparison with 3 satellite products from the Gravity Recovery and Climated Experiment (GRACE) shows a non negligible contribution of the deeper soil layers to the total storage (34% for groundwater and aquifer). The simulations also show a non negligible sensitivity of the simulations to rain uncertainties especially concerning the discharge. Finally, sensitivity tests show that a good parameterization of routing is required to optimize simulation errors. Indeed, the modification of certain key parameters which can be observed from space (notably river height and flooded zones height changes and extent) has an impact on the model dynamics, thus it is suggested that improving the model input parameters using future developments in remote sensing technologies such as the joint CNES-NASA satellite project SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography), which will provide water heights and extentat land surface with an unprecedented 50–100 m resolution and precision.</p>},

abstract = {A common term in the continental and oceanic components of the global water cycle is freshwater discharge to the oceans. Many estimates of the annual average global discharge have been made over the past 100 yr with a sur-prisingly wide range. As more observations have become available and continental-scale land surface model sim-ulations of runoff have improved, these past estimates are cast in a somewhat different light. In this paper, a combination of observations from 839 river gauging stations near the outlets of large river basins is used in com-bination with simulated runoff fields from two implementations of the Variable Infiltration Capacity land surface model to estimate continental runoff into the world's oceans from 1950 to 2008. The gauges used account for ;58% of continental areas draining to the ocean worldwide, excluding Greenland and Antarctica. This study estimates that flows to the world's oceans globally are 44 200 (62660) km 3 yr 21 (9% from Africa, 37% from Eurasia, 30% from South America, 16% from North America, and 8% from Australia–Oceania). These estimates are generally higher than previous estimates, with the largest differences in South America and Australia–Oceania. Given that roughly 42% of ocean-draining continental areas are ungauged, it is not surprising that estimates are sensitive to the land surface and hydrologic model (LSM) used, even with a correction applied to adjust for model bias. The results show that more and better in situ streamflow measurements would be most useful in reducing uncertainties, in particular in the southern tip of South America, the islands of Oceania, and central Africa.},

abstract = {New precipitation (P) datasets are released regularly, following innovations in weather forecasting models, satellite retrieval methods, and multi-source merging techniques. Using the conterminous US as a case study, we evaluated the performance of 26 gridded (sub-)daily P datasets to obtain insight into the merit of these innovations. The evaluation was performed at a daily timescale for the period 2008-2017 using the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), a performance metric combining correlation, bias, and variability. As a reference, we used the high-resolution (4 km) Stage-IV gauge-radar P dataset. Among the three KGE components, the P datasets performed worst overall in terms of correlation (related to event identification). In terms of improving KGE scores for these datasets, improved P totals (affecting the bias score) and improved distribution of P intensity (affecting the variability score) are of secondary importance. Among the 11 gauge-corrected P datasets, the best overall performance was obtained by MSWEP V2.2, underscoring the importance of applying daily gauge corrections and accounting for gauge reporting times. Several uncorrected P datasets outperformed gauge-corrected ones. Among the 15 uncorrected P datasets, the best performance was obtained by the ERA5-HRES fourth-generation reanalysis, reflecting the significant advances in earth system modeling during the last decade. The (re)analyses generally performed better in winter than in summer, while the opposite was the case for the satellite-based datasets. IMERGHH V05 performed substantially better than TMPA-3B42RT V7, attributable to the many improvements implemented in the IMERG satellite P retrieval algorithm. IMERGHH V05 outperformed ERA5-HRES in regions dominated by convective storms, while the opposite was observed in regions of complex terrain. The ERA5-EDA ensemble average exhibited higher correlations than the ERA5-HRES deterministic run, highlighting the value of ensemble modeling. The WRF regional convectionpermitting climate model showed considerably more accurate P totals over the mountainous west and performed best among the uncorrected datasets in terms of variability, suggesting there is merit in using high-resolution models to obtain climatological P statistics. Our findings provide some guidance to choose the most suitable P dataset for a particular application.},

abstract = {Current and forthcoming altimetry satellites provide increasing hydraulic visibility of river surface variabilities. However, due to unobservable river bathymetry and friction, as well as the sampling and quality of remote sensing data, discharge estimation remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a new rigorous methodology to estimate stage-fall-discharge laws at any point of a hydrographic network including backwater affected reaches. This methodology is adapted to operational estimation of discharge from multi-mission satellite altimetry data. The cornerstone of the method is to take advantage of meaningful hydraulic signatures, including water surface slopes, simulated by a river network model optimally combined with multi-satellite noisy observations. This optimal combination of heterogeneous multi-source data with a river network model is achieved through variational data assimilation performed using the DassFlow-HiVDI hydraulic model inflowed by MGB regional hydrological model. It is newly applied to the large and complex Negro-Branco River network in the Amazon basin. An effective model is obtained by variational calibration using Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A and -3B altimetry observations between February 2016 and May 2019. A fairly good fit bellow 1m for 80% of the altimetric observations is obtained. Using this hydrodynamic model as a fine spatio-temporal extrapolator of hydraulic quantities, and in particular of multi-scale water surface slope signatures, the parameters of a general SFD law, as well as the uncertainties estimations, can be constrained at any location within the river network domain using a Bayesian optimization method. This methodology is tested over 4 virtual stations representing various hydraulic complexities. Accurate discharge estimates and meaningful SFD parameters are obtained compared to those of the reference low Froude model at these locations. Analyses are also performed on a reference case with fine-scale bathymetry data of the Garonne River, France. The strength of the method lies in its applicability to noisy multi-satellite data while ensuring physical consistency. It should be applicable in real time to any river basin, using nadir altimetry only or combined to the forthcoming SWOT satellite data. Moreover, the method allows to take full advantage, via the hydrodynamic model, of variable water masks observations and physical segmentations of river networks.

abstract = {This work provides an initial overview of climate features and their related hydrological impacts during the recent extreme droughts (1995, 1998, 2005 and 2010) in the upper Solimes River (western Amazon), using comprehensive in situ discharge and rainfall datasets. The droughts are generally associated with positive SST anomalies in the tropical North Atlantic and weak trade winds and water vapor transport toward the upper Solimes, which, in association with increased subsidence over central and southern Amazon, explain the lack of rainfall and very low discharge values. But in 1998, toward the end of the 1997-98 El Nio event, the drought is more likely related to an anomalous divergence of water vapor in the western Amazon that is characteristic of a warm event in the Pacific. During the austral spring and winter of 2010, the most severe drought since the seventies has been registered in the upper Solimes. Its intensity and its length, when compared to the 2005 drought, can be explained by the addition of an El Nio in austral summer and a very warm episode in the Atlantic in boreal spring and summer. As in 2005, the lack of water in 2010 was more important in the southern tropical tributaries of the upper Solimes than in the northern ones. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {An innovative remote sensing approach that combines land-use change and water quality information is proposed in order to investigate if Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) area extension is associated with water siltation in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River Basin (Brazil), containing the largest small-scale gold mining district in the world. Taking advantage of a 40-year period of the multi-satellite imagery archive, the objective of this paper is to build a normalized time-series in order to evaluate the influence of temporal mining expansion on the water siltation data (TSS, Total Suspended Solids concentration) derived from previous research. The methodological approach was set to deliver a full characterization of the ASGM expansion from its initial stages in the early 1970s to the present. First, based on IRS/LISSIII images acquired in 2012, the historical Landsat image database (1973–2001) was corrected for radiometric and atmospheric effects using dark vegetation as reference to create a normalized time-series. Next, a complete update of the mining areas distribution in 2012 derived from the TerraClass Project (an official land-use classification for the Brazilian Amazon) was conducted having IRS/LISSIII as the base map with the support of auxiliary data and vector editing. Once the ASGM in 2012 was quantified (261.7 km2) and validated with photos, a reverse classification of ASGM in 2001 (171.7 km2), 1993 (166.3 km2), 1984 (47.5 km2), and 1973 (15.4 km2) with the use of Landsat archives was applied. This procedure relies on the assumption that ASGM changes in the land cover are severe and remain detectable from satellite sensors for decades. The mining expansion area over time was then combined with the (TSS) data retrieved from the same atmospherically corrected satellite imagery based on the literature. In terms of gold mining expansion and water siltation effects, four main periods of ASGM activities were identified in the study area: (i) 1958–1977, first occurrence of mining activities and low water impacts; (ii) 1978–1993, introduction of low-budget mechanization associated with very high gold prices resulting in large mining area expansion and high water siltation levels; (iii) 1994–2003, general recession of ASGM activities and exhaustion of easy-access gold deposits, resulting in decreased TSS; (iv) 2004 to present, intensification of ASGM encouraged by high gold prices, resulting in an increase of TSS.},

abstract = {An assessment is made of the global energy and hydrological cycles from eight current atmospheric reanalyses and their depiction of changes over time. A brief evaluation of the water and energy cycles in the latest version of the NCAR climate model referred to as CCSM4 is also given. The focus is on the mean ocean, land, and global precipitation P; the corresponding evaporation E; their difference corresponding to the surface freshwater flux E–P; and the vertically integrated atmospheric moisture transports. Using the model-based P and E, the time-and area-average E–P for the oceans, P–E for land, and the moisture transport from ocean to land should all be identical but are not close in most reanalyses, and often differ significantly from observational estimates of the surface return flow based on net river discharge into the oceans. Their dif-ferences reveal outstanding issues with atmospheric models and their biases, which are manifested as analysis increments in the reanalyses. The NCAR CCSM4, along with most reanalysis models, the exception being MERRA, has too-intense water cycling (P and E) over the ocean although ocean-to-land transports are very close to observed. Precipitation from reanalyses that assimilate moisture from satellite observations exhibits large changes identified with the changes in the observing system, as new and improved temperature and water vapor channels are assimilated and, while P improves after about 2002, E–P does not. Discrepancies among hydrological cycle components arise from analysis increments that can add or subtract moisture. The large-scale moisture budget divergences are more stable in time and similar across reanalyses than model-based estimates of E–P. Results are consistent with the view that recycling of moisture is too large in most models and the lifetime of moisture is too short. For the energy cycle, most reanalyses have spurious im-balances of ;10 W m 22 within the atmosphere, and ;5–10 W m 22 in net fluxes into the surface and to space. Major improvements are needed in model treatment and assimilation of moisture, and surface fluxes from reanalyses should only be used with great caution.},

abstract = {The error characterization of satellite observations is crucial for blending observations from multiple platforms into a unique dataset and for assimilating them into numerical weather prediction models. In the last years, the triple collocation (TC) technique has been widely used to assess the quality of many geophysical variables acquired with different instruments and at different scales. This paper presents a new formulation of the triple collocation (Correlated Triple Collocation (CTC)) for the case of three datasets that resolve similar spatial scales, with two of them being error-correlated datasets. Besides, the formulation is designed to ensure fast convergence of the error estimators. This approach is of special interest in cases such that finding more than three datasets with uncorrelated errors is not possible and the amount of data is limited. First, a synthetic experiment has been carried out to assess the performance of CTC formulation. As an example of application, the error characterization of three collocated L-band brightness temperature (TB) measurements over land has been performed. Two of the datasets come from ESA (European Space Agency) SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission: one is the reconstructed TB from the operational L1B v620 product, and the other is the reconstructed TB from the operational L1B v620 product resulting from application of an RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) mitigation technique, the nodal sampling (NS). The third is an independent dataset, the TB acquired by a NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) radiometer. Our analysis shows that the application of NS leads to TB error reduction with respect to the current version of SMOS TB in 80% of the points in the global map, with an average reduction of approximately 1 K over RFI-free regions and approximately 1.45 K over strongly RFI-contaminated areas.},

abstract = {Important characteristics of watershed processes can be extracted from hydrologic data using spectral methods. We extract quantitative information from precipitation, stream discharge, and groundwater head data from watersheds in northern-lower Michigan using Fourier Transform (FT) methods. By comparing the spectra of these data using similar units, we graphically illustrate the hydrologic processes that link precipitation to stream discharge and groundwater levels including evapotranspiration. We also demonstrate how unit hydrographs can be efficiently and non-parametrically derived using the FT in a manner that allows for a quantitative seasonal comparison of precipitation and the resulting stream discharge response. This analysis clearly illustrates the reduction in summer discharge levels due to canopy interception and evapotranspiration. We also develop a systematic application of the FT we call the Scaled-Windowed Fourier Transform (SWFT), which extracts time-varying spectral content using a similar approach to the wavelet transform. While computationally less efficient than the wavelet transform, the SWFT allows for embedded detrending and tapering. Application of this method clearly illustrates the non-stationarities of spectral content within the three chosen data types, leading to a greater understanding of discharge-generating processes.},

abstract = {Surface fresh water is essential for life, yet we have surprisingly poor knowledge of the spatial and temporal dynamics of surface freshwater discharge and changes in storage globally. For example, we are unable to answer such basic questions as "What is the spatial and temporal variability of water stored on and near the surface of all continents?" Furthermore, key societal issues, such as the susceptibility of life to flood hazards, cannot be answered with the current global, in situ networks designed to observe river discharge at points but not flood events. The measurements required to answer these hydrologic questions are surface water area, the elevation of the water surface (h), its slope (∂h/&∂x), and temporal change (∂h/∂t). Advances in remote sensing hydrology, particularly over the past 10 years and even more recently, have demonstrated that these hydraulic variables can be measured reliably from orbiting platforms. Measurements of inundated area have been used to varying degrees of accuracy as proxies for discharge but are successful only when in situ data are available for calibration; they fail to indicate the dynamic topography of water surfaces. Radar altimeters have a rich, multidecadal history of successfully measuring elevations of the ocean surface and are now also accepted as capable tools for measuring h along orbital profiles crossing freshwater bodies. However, altimeters are profiling tools, which, because of their orbital spacings, miss too many freshwater bodies to be useful hydrologically. High spatial resolution images of ∂h/∂t have been observed with interferometric synthetic aperture radar, but the method requires emergent vegetation to scatter radar pulses back to the receiving antenna. Essentially, existing spaceborne methods have been used to measure components of surface water hydraulics, but none of the technologies can singularly supply the water volume and hydraulic measurements that are needed to accurately model the water cycle and to guide water management practices. Instead, a combined imaging and elevation-measuring approach is ideal as demonstrated by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which collected images of h at a high spatial resolution (∼90 m) thus permitting the calculation of ∂h/∂x. We suggest that a future satellite concept, the Water and Terrestrial Elevation Recovery mission, will improve upon the SRTM design to permit multitemporal mappings of h across the world's wetlands, floodplains, lakes, reservoirs, and rivers.

abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67% to 77%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

abstract = {Abstract?The COordinating Earth observation data validation for RE-analysis for CLIMAte ServiceS? project (CORE-CLIMAX) aimed to substantiate how Copernicus observations and products can contribute to climate change analyses. CORE-CLIMAX assessed the European capability to provide climate data records (CDRs) of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), prepared a structured process to derive CDRs, developed a harmonized approach for validating Essential Climate Variable CDRs, identified the integration of CDRs into the reanalysis chain, and formulated a process to compare the results of different reanalysis techniques. With respect to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) the systematic application and further development of the CORE-CLIMAX system maturity matrix (SMM) and the spin-off Application Performance Metric (APM) were strongly endorsed to be involved in future implementation of C3S. We concluded that many of the current CDRs are not yet sufficiently mature to be used in reanalysis or applied in climate studies. Thus, the production of consistent high resolution data records remains a challenge and needs more research urgently. Extending ECVs to close climate cycle budgets (e.g. Essential Water Variables) is a next step linking CDRs to sectoral applications.},

abstract = {In large Tropical River basins such as the Amazon, groundwater plays a major role in the water and ecological cycles with large influences on the rainforest ecosystems and climate variability. However, due to the lack of monitoring networks, Amazon groundwater storage and its variability remain poorly known. Here, we provide an unprecedented direct estimate of the spatio-temporal variations of the anomaly of groundwater storage over the period January 2003 -September 2010 in the Amazon Basin by decomposing the total terrestrial water storage measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission into the individual contributions of other hydrological reservoirs, using multi-satellite data for the surface waters and floodplains and models outputs for the soil moisture. We show that the seasonal variations of groundwater storage represent between 20 and 35% of the terrestrial water storage seasonal volume variations of the Amazon. Larger seasonal amplitudes of groundwater storage (>450 mm) are found in the Alter do Ch{\~{a}}o and I{\c{c}}a aquifers in the central part of the Amazon Basin. Anomalies of groundwater storage exhibit a strong interannual variability (STD reaching 120 mm along the central corridor) during the study period in response to hydrologic variability and climatic events such as the extreme drought that occurred in 2005.},

abstract = {Since the beginning of the 1990s, sea level is routinely measured using high-precision satellite altimetry. Over the past *25 years, several groups worldwide involved in processing the satellite altimetry data regularly provide updates of sea level time series at global and regional scales. Here we present an ongoing effort supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Programme for improving the altimetry-based sea level products. Two main objectives characterize this enterprise: (1) to make use of ESA missions (ERS-1 and 2 and Envisat) in addition to the so-called 'reference' missions like TOPEX/Poseidon and the Jason series in the computation of the sea level time series, and (2) to improve all processing steps in order to meet the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) accuracy requirements defined for a set of 50 Essential Climate Variables, sea level being one of them. We show that improved geophysical corrections, dedicated processing algorithms, reduction of instrumental bias and drifts, and careful linkage between missions led to improved sea level products. Regarding the long-term trend, the new global mean sea level record accuracy now approaches the GCOS requirements (of *0.3 mm/year). Regional trend uncertainty has been reduced by a factor of *2, but orbital and wet tropo-spheric corrections errors still prevent fully reaching the GCOS accuracy requirement. Similarly at the interannual time scale, the global mean sea level still displays 2–4 mm errors that are not yet fully understood. The recent launch of new altimetry missions (Sentinel-3, Jason-3) and the inclusion of data from currently flying missions (e.g., CryoSat, SARAL/ AltiKa) may provide further improvements to this important climate record.},

abstract = {Although it is well established that transpiration contributes much of the water for rainfall over Amazonia, it remains unclear whether transpiration helps to drive or merely responds to the seasonal cycle of rainfall. Here, we use multiple independent satellite datasets to show that rainforest transpiration enables an increase of shallow convection that moistens and destabilizes the atmosphere during the initial stages of the dry-to-wet season transition. This shallow convection moisture pump (SCMP) preconditions the atmosphere at the regional scale for a rapid increase in rain-bearing deep convection, which in turn drives moisture convergence and wet season onset 2–3 mo before the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Aerosols produced by late dry season biomass burning may alter the efficiency of the SCMP. Our results highlight the mechanisms by which interactions among land surface processes, atmospheric convection, and biomass burning may alter the timing of wet season onset and provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how deforestation extends the dry season and enhances regional vulnerability to drought.},

abstract = {The prominent Andes cordillera induces significant differences in climates between its eastern and western slopes. These climatic differences are largely reflected by contrasting vegetation and ice coverages but remain poorly documented. This study quantifies the abrupt changes of precipitation and cloud properties at both sides of the Andes south of 20°S by using surface daily precipitation and satellite (CloudSat and MODIS) data during the 2006-2016 period. Results show that the precipitation changes drastically and precipitating clouds can be of very different nature on each side of the Andes. In the tropical Andes (20-25°S), precipitation normally falls from a sole layer of thick stratiform and convective precipitating clouds during the warm semester, but the annual mean accumulation is about 10-100 times larger on the eastern than on the western slopes. A sole layer of low stratus clouds dominates over the Pacific coast, occasionally producing light rains, whereas high, thin, and non-precipitating clouds dominate most of the time over the continent. In the subtropical Andes (25-35°S), annual mean precipitation is similar on both sides, however, it falls from convective and stratiform precipitating clouds in the warm semester on the eastern slopes, and from stratiform precipitating clouds in the cold semester, mostly as frozen particles, on the western slopes. These different features on both slopes denote a climatic transition between the tropics and extratropics. In the extratropical Andes (south of 35°S), stratiform cloud types produces precipitation on both sides during all the year, but the annual mean precipitation and cloud frequency are enhanced on the western slopes and strongly reduced on the eastern slopes of the Andes. Cloud frequencies are higher than in the subtropics and evenly distributed as single- or multi-layers of low, middle and high clouds. Frozen particles become important in precipitating clouds over the mountains and on the lee side. These findings demonstrate the significant influence of the Andes cordillera on the climate all along southwestern South America, and constitute an excellent example of how the simple dependence of climate on latitude can be substantially altered by the topography.},

The application of DL techniques in the field of pixel-level image fusion has also emerged as an active topic in the last three years. This survey paper presents a systematic review of the DL-based pixel-level image fusion literature. Specifically, we first summarize the main difficulties that exist in conventional image fusion research and discuss the advantages that DL can offer to address each of these problems. Then, the recent achievements in DL-based image fusion are reviewed in detail. More than a dozen recently proposed image fusion methods based on DL techniques including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), convolutional sparse representation (CSR) and stacked autoencoders (SAEs) are introduced. At last, by summarizing the existing DL-based image fusion methods into several generic frameworks and presenting a potential DL-based framework for developing objective evaluation metrics, we put forward some prospects for the future study on this topic. The key issues and challenges that exist in each framework are discussed.},

abstract = {Recent retrievals of multiple satellite products for each component of the terrestrial water cycle provide an opportunity to estimate the water budget globally. In this study, we estimate the water budget from satellite remote sensing over ten global river basins for 2003-2006. We use several satellite and non-satellite precipitation (P) and evapo-transpiration (ET) products in this study. The satellite precipitation products are the GPCP, TRMM, CMORPH and PERSIANN. For ET, we use four products generated from three retrieval models (Penman-Monteith (PM), Priestley-Taylor (PT) and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS)) with data inputs from the Earth Observing System (EOS) or the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) products. GPCP precipitation and PM (ISCCP) ET have less bias and errors over most of the river basins. To estimate the total water budget from satellite data for each basin, we generate merged products for P and ET by combining the four P and four ET products using weighted values based on their errors with respect to non-satellite merged product. The water storage change component is taken from GRACE satellite data, which are used directly with a single pre-specified error value. In the absence of satellite retrievals of river discharge, we use in-situ gauge measurements. Closure of the water budget over the river basins from the combined satellite and in-situ discharge products is not achievable with errors of the order of 5-25% of mean annual precipitation. A constrained ensemble Kalman filter is used to close the water budget and provide a constrained best-estimate of the water budget. The non-closure error from each water budget component is estimated and it is found that the merged satellite precipitation product carries most of the non-closure error. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this study, a global Land Data Assimilation system (LDAS-Monde) is tested over Europe and the Mediterranean basin to increase monitoring accuracy for land surface variables. LDAS-Monde is able to ingest information from satellite-derived surface Soil Moisture (SM) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) observations to constrain the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model (LSM) coupled with the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}orologiques) version of the Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (ISBA-CTRIP) continental hydrological system. It makes use of the CO<sub>2</sub>-responsive version of ISBA which models leaf-scale physiological processes and plant growth. Transfer of water and heat in the soil rely on a multilayer diffusion scheme. Surface SM and LAI observations are assimilated using a simplified extended Kalman filter (SEKF), which uses finite differences from perturbed simulations to generate flow-dependence between the observations and the model control variables. The latter include LAI and seven layers of soil (from 1&thinsp;cm to 100&thinsp;cm depth). A sensitivity test of the Jacobians over 2000&ndash;2012 exhibits effects related to both depth and season. It also suggests that observations of both LAI and surface SM have an impact on the different control variables. From the assimilation of surface SM, the LDAS is more effective in modifying soil-moisture from the top layers of soil as model sensitivity to surface SM decreases with depth and has almost no impact from 60&thinsp;cm downwards. From the assimilation of LAI, a strong impact on LAI itself is found. The LAI assimilation impact is more pronounced in SM layers that contain the highest fraction of roots (from 10&thinsp;cm to 60&thinsp;cm). The assimilation is more efficient in summer and autumn than in winter and spring. Assimilation impact shows that the LDAS works well constraining the model to the observations and that stronger corrections are applied to LAI than to SM. The assimilation impact's evaluation is successfully carried out using (i) agricultural statistics over France, (ii) river discharge observations, (iii) satellite-derived estimates of land evapotranspiration from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) project and (iv) spatially gridded observations based estimates of up-scaled gross primary production and evapotranspiration from the FLUXNET network.

GRACE data show an alarming rate of decrease in total water storage of approximately -27.2±0.6 mm yr-1 equivalent water height, equal to a volume of 143.6 km3 during the course of the study period. Additional remote-sensing information and output from land surface models were used to identify that groundwater losses are the major source of this trend. The approach used in this study provides an example of best current capabilities in regions like the Middle East, where data access can be severely limited. Results indicate that the region lost 17.3±2.1 mm yr-1 equivalent water height of groundwater during the study period, or 91.3±10.9 km 3 in volume. Furthermore, results raise important issues regarding water use in transboundary river basins and aquifers, including the necessity of international water use treaties and resolving discrepancies in international water law, while amplifying the need for increased monitoring for core components of the water budget. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {1 This paper demonstrates the potential of combining observed river discharge information with climate-driven water balance model (WBM) outputs to develop composite runoff fields. Such combined runoff fields simultaneously reflect the numerical accuracy of the discharge measurements and preserve the spatial and temporal distribution of simulated runoff. Selected gauging stations from the World Meteorological Organization Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) data archive were geographically coregistered to a gridded simulated topological network at 30 (longitude latitude) spatial resolution (STN-30p). Interstation regions between gauging stations along the STN-30p network were identified, and annual interstation runoff was calculated. The annual interstation runoff was compared with outputs from WBM calculations, which were performed using long-term mean monthly climate forcings (air temperature and precipitation). The simulated runoff for each cell was multiplied by the ratio of observed to simulated runoff of the corresponding interstation region from the GRDC data set to create spatially distributed runoff fields at 30 resolution. The resulting composite runoff fields (UNH/GRDC Composite Runoff Fields V1.0) are released to the scientific community along with intermediate data sets, such as station attributes and long-term monthly regimes of the selected gauging stations, the simulated topological network (STN-30p), STN-30p derived attributes for the selected stations, and gridded fields of the interstation regions along STN-30p. These data sets represent high-resolution fields that are of value to a broad range of water-related research, including terrestrial modeling, climate-atmosphere interactions, and global water resource assessments.},

We have analyzed spectra from CRISM images and used co-located HiRISE images in order to further characterize these carbonate-bearing units. We applied absorption band mapping techniques to investigate a range of possible phyllosilicate and carbonate minerals that could be present in the Nili Fossae region. We also describe a clay-carbonate hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblage in the Archean Warrawoona Group of Western Australia that is a potential Earth analog to the Nili Fossae carbonate-bearing rock units. We discuss the geological and biological implications for hydrothermal processes on Noachian Mars.},

abstract = {The fluvial belt of the Amazon River is a complex of Quaternary sedimentary units of different ages and formation conditions. Present position of the channel and the morphology and size of the alluvial plain are related to neo-tectonic lineaments. In the study area the main channel of the Solimōes is nearly straight. The river may be considered anastomosed, albeit with few islands and anabranches. The main Holocene units are the impeded floodplain and the channel-dominated floodplain. The channel-dominated floodplain is a complex mosaic of fluvial forms, including younger channels, active sandbars, islands, levees, scroll-dominated plains, and abandoned belts. The impeded floodplain is a widespread unit characterised by a very flat surface and round or irregularly shaped lakes. The impeded drainage flood plain is only partially affected by the present floods, and even those parts affected by floods receive little or no sediment from the main channel. More important sediment contribution is by alluvial plain channels from the Solimōes branches that generate deltas in the impeded floodplain lakes. The impeded floodplain is interpreted to be an earlier stage in the evolution of the Holocene alluvial belt. The formation was marked by widespread vertical accretion and a channel morphogenetically less active than at present. The later stage is associated with an active main channel and the paran{\'{a}}s, and generation of a scroll-dominated plain. This very large river system had a complex and delayed response to variations in the hydrological conditions induced by changes in the regional climate during the Late Holocene. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {An initial ground validation of the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Day-1 product from March 2014 to August 2015 is presented for the tropical Andes. IMERG was evaluated along with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) against 302 quality-controlled rain gauges across Ecuador and Peru. Detection, quantitative estimation statistics, and probability distribution functions are calculated at different spatial (0.1°, 0.25°) and temporal (1 h, 3 h, daily) scales. Precipitation products are analyzed for hydrometeorologically distinct subregions. Results show that IMERG has a superior detection and quantitative rainfall intensity estimation ability than TMPA, particularly in the high Andes. Despite slightly weaker agreement of mean rainfall fields, IMERG shows better characterization of gauge observations when separating rainfall detection and rainfall rate estimation. At corresponding space-time scales, IMERG shows better estimation of gauge rainfall probability distributions than TMPA. However, IMERG shows no improvement in both rainfall detection and rainfall rate estimation along the dry Peruvian coastline, where major random and systematic errors persist. Further research is required to identify which rainfall intensities are missed or falsely detected and how errors can be attributed to specific satellite sensor retrievals. The satellite-gauge difference was associated with the point-area difference in spatial support between gauges and satellite precipitation products, particularly in areas with low and irregular gauge network coverage. Future satellite-gauge evaluations need to identify such locations and investigate more closely interpixel point-area differences before attributing uncertainties to satellite products.},

abstract = {Road extraction is one of the most significant tasks for modern transportation systems. This task is normally difficult due to complex backgrounds such as rural roads that have heterogeneous appearances with large intraclass and low interclass variations and urban roads that are covered by vehicles, pedestrians and the shadows of surrounding trees or buildings. In this paper, we propose a novel method for extracting roads from optical satellite images using a refined deep residual convolutional neural network (RDRCNN) with a postprocessing stage. RDRCNN consists of a residual connected unit (RCU) and a dilated perception unit (DPU). The RDRCNN structure is symmetric to generate the outputs of the same size. A math morphology and a tensor voting algorithm are used to improve RDRCNN performance during postprocessing. Experiments are conducted on two datasets of high-resolution images to demonstrate the performance of the proposed network architectures, and the results of the proposed architectures are compared with those of other network architectures. The results demonstrate the effective performance of the proposed method for extracting roads from a complex scene.},

The adjustment is based on the spatially variable ratio of rainrate estimates from coincident microwave and infrared data, which is then applied to the full geo-IR data set. The resulting "microwave-adjusted geo-IR rain estimate' has the (usually low) bias of the microwave estimates, together with the smoothness and temporal coverage of the geo-IR data. Here, the microwave estimates from the Goddard Scattering Algorithm (GSCAT) are used to adjust the geo-IR estimates from the Geosynchronous Precipitation Index (GPI) to form the Adjusted GPI (AGPI) technique. -from Authors},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal variations of water volume over inundated areas located in a large river basin have been determined using combined observations from a multisatellite inundation data set, the TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) altimetry satellite, and in situ hydrographic stations for the water levels over rivers and floodplains. We computed maps of monthly surface water volume change over the period of common availability of T/P and the multisatellite data (1993-2000). The basin of the Negro River, the largest tributary in terms of discharge to the Amazon River, was selected as a test site. A strong seasonal signal is observed with minima in October and maxima in June. A strong interannual component is also present, particularly important during ENSO years. The surface water change was estimated to be 167 {\textpm} 39 km3 between October 1995 (low water) and June 1996 (high water). This result is consistent with previous estimates obtained for the 1995-1996 hydrological cycle over the same area using the JERS mosaic data. The surface water volume change is then compared to the total water volume change inferred from the GRACE satellite for an average annual cycle. The difference between the surface storage change and the total storage change derived from GRACE was computed to estimate the contribution of the soil moisture and groundwater to the total storage change. Our study supports the hypothesis that total water storage is almost equally partitioned between surface water and the combination of soil moisture and groundwater for the Negro River basin. The water volume changes are also evaluated using in situ discharge measurements and the GPCP precipitation product (correlation of 0.61). The results show the high potential for the new technique to provide valuable information to improve our understanding of large river basin hydrologic processes.},

abstract = {Rainfall and river indices for both the northern and southern Amazon were used to identify and explore long-term climate variability on the region. From a statistical analysis of the hydrometeorological series, it is concluded that no systematic unidirectional long-term trends towards drier or wetter conditions have been identified since the 1920s. The rainfall and river series showing variability at inter-annual scales linked to El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation was detected in rainfall in the northern Amazon. It has a low-frequency variability with a peak at -30 years identified in both rainfall and river series in the Amazon. The presence of cycles rather than a trend is characteristic of rainfall in the Amazon. These cycles are real indicators of decadal and multi-decadal variations in hydrology for both sides of the basin. Sea-level pressure (SLP) gradients between tropics and sub topics were explored in order to explain variability in the hydrometeorology of the basin. Sea surface temperature (SST) gradients inside the tropical Atlantic and between the tropical Atlantic and the sub-tropical Atlantic have been assessed in the context of changes in rainfall in the Amazon, as compared to northern Argentina. Trends in SSTs in the subtropical Atlantic are linked to changes in rainfall and circulation in northern Argentina, and they seem to be related to multi-decadal variations of rainfall in the Amazon.

abstract = {Balancing global moisture budgets is a difficult task that is even more challenging at regional scales. At-mospheric water budget components are investigated within five tropical (158S–158N) ocean regions, in-cluding the Indian Ocean, three Pacific regions, and one Atlantic region, to determine how well data products balance these budgets. Initially, a selection of independent observations and a reanalysis product are eval-uated to determine overall closure, between 1998 and 2007. Satellite-based observations from SeaFlux evaporation and Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation, together with Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data products, were chosen. Freshwater flux (evaporation minus precipitation) observations and reanalysis atmospheric moisture divergence regional averages are assessed for closure. Moisture budgets show the best closure over the Indian Ocean with a correlation of 89% and an overall imbalance of 23.0% of the anomalies. Of the five regions, the western Pacific Ocean region produces the worst atmospheric moisture budget closure of 221.1%, despite a high correlation of 93%. Average closure over the five regions is within 8.1%, and anomalies are correlated at 83%. ERA-Interim and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) evaporation rates are 29 and 19 mm month 21 greater than SeaFlux, respectively. To diagnose the differences, wind speed and humidity gradients of the three products are compared utilizing the bulk formula for evaporation. SeaFlux wind speeds are higher, but sea–air humidity gradients are lower. Higher humidity gradients in the reanalyses are due to much dryer near-surface air in ERA-Interim, and the same to a lesser degree in MERRA. These differences counteract each other somewhat, but overall humidity biases exceed wind biases. This is consistent with buoy observations.},

This paper puts forward a novel algorithm involving the convolutional neural network (CNN) and guided filtering for SAR image denoising, which combines the advantages of model-based optimization and discriminant learning and considers how to obtain the best image information and improve the resolution of the images. The advantages of proposed method are that, firstly, an SAR image is filtered via five different level denoisers to obtain five denoised images, in which the efficient and effective CNN denoiser prior is employed. Later, a guided filtering-based fusion algorithm is used to integrate the five denoised images into a final denoised image. The experimental results indicate that the algorithm cannot eliminate noise, but it does improve the visual effect of the image significantly, allowing it to outperform some recent denoising methods in this field.},

abstract = {<p>Cloud detection, which is defined as the pixel-wise binary classification, is significant in satellite imagery processing. In current remote sensing literature, cloud detection methods are linked to the relationships of imagery bands or based on simple image feature analysis. These methods, which only focus on low-level features, are not robust enough on the images with difficult land covers, for clouds share similar image features such as color and texture with the land covers. To solve the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for cloud detection on satellite imagery by utilizing multilevel image features with two major processes. The first process is to obtain the cloud probability map from the designed deep convolutional neural network, which concatenates deep neural network features from low-level to high-level. The second part of the method is to get refined cloud masks through a composite image filter technique, where the specific filter captures multilevel features of cloud structures and the surroundings of the input imagery. In the experiments, the proposed method achieves 85.38% intersection over union of cloud in the testing set which contains 100 Gaofen-1 wide field of view images and obtains satisfactory visual cloud masks, especially for those hard images. The experimental results show that utilizing multilevel features by the combination of the network with feature concatenation and the particular filter tackles the cloud detection problem with improved cloud masks.</p>},

abstract = {Modern hydrology relies on multiple sources of information combined with climatological, hydrological and glaciological data. These data can be collected through various sources such as private initiatives by companies, research programs, and both national and international organisms. They also vary by types, e.g., in situ measurements, satellite, reanalysis and simulated data. Recently the ANDEX research project, as a GEWEX regional program, was created to understand the processes related to the hydrological cycle and energy fluxes in the Andean region from Colombia to Patagonia. It is quite challenging to carry out this program given the complex orography and diversity of climates from tropical to sub-polar climates. This review article is a compilation of the various databases that are useful for hydrometeorological research in the South American Andes. The National Meteorological and Hydrological Services in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela and Argentina provide a large amount of data however the high-elevation areas are poorly instrumented and the number of stations varies greatly between the countries. National databases are only partially shared with the international bodies responsible for summarizing the existing data; this causes problems in term of data product assimilation. Across the entire continent, too few radiosondes are being used despite the fact that these data are crucial for validating and identifying problems in the atmospheric models. An increasing number of satellite data are available but it is difficult to assimilate them into the hydroclimatological models suited to the adjusted spatial and temporal resolutions. Specifically, for precipitation, we recommend merged products that account for the high spatial and temporal variability across the Andes. Finally, the international ANDEX program could be an excellent opportunity to increase the knowledge of the hydrological processes in the Andes.},

Recent efforts have classified land cover across this vast region, although they disagree on the location and amount of cropland and do not directly address pasture, a land use that has grown in importance in the last 2 decades. Here we present an analysis of land cover and land use practices over the Amazon and Tocantins basins of South America. In this study, we demonstrate how satellite imagery and agricultural censuses can be merged in order to provide a geographically explicit, fine-scale description of land cover and land use practices. The result depicts the fraction of each 5- min (9 × 9 km) grid cell that was devoted to agricultural activity during the mid-1990s. The resultant map retains many of the characteristics of the agricultural census data, but with a much finer spatial resolution. During the mid-1990s, cultivated area is estimated to have been 1.7 × 107 ha (2.5% of the basin), natural pasture is estimated at 3.3 × 107 ha (4.9% of the basin), and planted pasture is estimated to cover 3.3 × 107 ha (4.9% of the basin). Perhaps more important than the quantities, however, is that these data sets provide a new blend of ground-based and satellite-based spatially explicit data. This snapshot can be used as a basis to project either forward or backward in time, as a new check of finer scale land use classifications or as a driver of ecosystem models.},

Results are used to provide a new estimate of the global hydrological cycle for long-term annual means that includes estimates of the main reservoirs of water as well as the flows of water among them. For precipitation P over land a comparison among three datasets enables uncertainties to be estimated. In addition, results are presented for the mean annual cycle of the atmospheric hydrological cycle based on 1979–2000 data. These include monthly estimates of P, evapotranspiration E, atmospheric moisture convergence over land, and changes in atmospheric storage, for the major continental landmasses, zonal means over land, hemispheric land means, and global land means. The evapotranspiration is computed from the Community Land Model run with realistic atmospheric forcings, including precipitation that is constrained by observations for monthly means but with high-frequency information taken from atmospheric reanalyses. Results for E Ϫ P are contrasted with those from atmospheric moisture budgets based on 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data. The latter show physically unrealistic results, because evaporation often exceeds precipitation over land, especially in the Tropics and subtropics.},

abstract = {In the central Amazon, surrounding Manaus City, Brazil, the landscape dominated by forest and water bodies supports development of river breezes. Seasonal inundations modify this local scenery affecting, consequently, the local circulations. However, this effect has not properly been investigated yet. Thus, we carried out numerical experiments for a river breeze case to investigate the seasonal flooding effect on the river breeze and detail the processes involved in the river breeze development. In the numerical experiments, we ran the Catchment-Based Macro-scale Floodplain (CaMa-Flood) model to simulate flooding depth and extent and used the CaMa-Flood outputs to force the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model. The seasonal flooding alters the surface energy partitioning causing a temperature decrease over the river region and intensification of the river breezes in the daytime. The intensified river breezes propagate more rapidly through the upland region, take longer to dissipate and promote stronger upward vertical motion altering the heat and mass transport. These novel findings are fundamentally important to the understanding of the local climate variability of the central Amazon. We can infer that river breezes and its consequence to local climate are less (more) pronounced in drought (wet) years.},

In this work, we used three decades (1983-2014) of PERSIANN-CDR daily rainfall data to characterize precipitation patterns in the southern part of the Amazon basin, which has been drastically impacted in recent decades by anthropogenic activities that exacerbate the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall regimes. We computed metrics for the rainy season (onset date, demise date and duration) on a pixel-to-pixel basis for each year in the time series. We identified significant trends toward a shortening of the rainy season in the southern Amazon, mainly linked to earlier demise dates. This work thus contributes to monitoring possible signs of climate change in the region and to assessing uncertainties in rainfall trends and their potential impacts on human activities and natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {This paper reviews recent progress in the study and understanding of extreme seasonal events in the Amazon region, focusing on drought and floods. The review includes a history of droughts and floods in the past, in the present and some discussions on future extremes in the context of climate change and its impacts on the Amazon region. Several extreme hydrological events, some of them characterized as 'once in a century', have been reported in the Amazon region during the last decade. While abundant rainfall in various sectors of the basin has determined extreme floods along the river's main stem in 1953, 1989, 1999, 2009, 2012-2015, deficient rainfall in 1912, 1926, 1963, 1980, 1983, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2010 has caused anomalously low river levels, and an increase in the risk and number of fires in the region, with consequences for humans. This is consistent with changes in the variability of the hydrometeorology of the basin and suggests that extreme hydrological events have been more frequent in the last two decades. Some of these intense/reduced rainfalls and subsequent floods/droughts were associated (but not exclusively) with La Ni{\~{n}}a/El Ni{\~{n}}o events. In addition, moisture transport anomalies from the tropical Atlantic into Amazonia, and from northern to southern Amazonia alter the water cycle in the region year-to-year. We also assess the impacts of such extremes on natural and human systems in the region, considering ecological, economic and societal impacts in urban and rural areas, particularly during the recent decades. In the context of the future climate change, studies show a large range of uncertainty, but suggest that drought might intensify through the 21st century.},

abstract = {Studies that investigate and evaluate the quality, limitations and uncertainties of satellite rainfall estimates are fundamental to assure the correct and successful use of these products in applications, such as climate studies, hydrological modeling and natural hazard monitoring. Over regions of the globe that lack in situ observations, such studies are only possible through intensive field measurement campaigns, which provide a range of high quality ground measurements, e.g., CHUVA (Cloud processes of tHe main precipitation systems in Brazil: A contribUtion to cloud resolVing modeling and to the GlobAl Precipitation Measurement) and GoAmazon (Observations and Modeling of the Green Ocean Amazon) over the Brazilian Amazon during 2014/2015. This study aims to assess the characteristics of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite-based precipitation estimates in representing the diurnal cycle over the Brazilian Amazon. The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) and the Goddard Profiling Algorithm-Version 2014 (GPROF2014) algorithms are evaluated against ground-based radar observations. Specifically, the S-band weather radar from the Amazon Protection National System (SIPAM), is first validated against the X-band CHUVA radar and then used as a reference to evaluate GPM precipitation. Results showed satisfactory agreement between S-band SIPAM radar and both IMERG and GPROF2014 algorithms. However, during the wet season, IMERG, which uses the GPROF2014 rainfall retrieval from the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) sensor, significantly overestimates the frequency of heavy rainfall volumes around 00:00-04:00 UTC and 15:00-18:00 UTC. This overestimation is particularly evident over the Negro, Solim{\~{o}}es and Amazon rivers due to the poorly-calibrated algorithm over water surfaces. On the other hand, during the dry season, the IMERG product underestimates mean precipitation in comparison to the S-band SIPAM radar, mainly due to the fact that isolated convective rain cells in the afternoon are not detected by the satellite precipitation algorithm.},

abstract = {Cirrus clouds determine the radiative balance of the upper troposphere and the transport of water vapor across the tropopause. The representation of vertical wind velocity, W, in atmospheric models constitutes the largest source of uncertainty in the calculation of the cirrus formation rate. Using global atmospheric simulations with a spatial resolution of 7 km we obtain for the first time a direct estimate of the distribution of W at the scale relevant for cirrus formation, validated against long-term observations at two different ground sites. The standard deviation in W, $\sigma$ w, varies widely over the globe with the highest values resulting from orographic uplift and convection, and the lowest occurring in the Arctic. Globally about 90% of the simulated $\sigma$ w values are below 0.1 m s-1 and about one in 104 cloud formation events occur in environments with $\sigma$ w > 0.8 m s-1. Combining our estimate with reanalysis products and an advanced cloud formation scheme results in lower homogeneous ice nucleation frequency than previously reported, and a decreasing average ice crystal concentration with decreasing temperature. These features are in agreement with observations and suggest that the correct parameterization of $\sigma$ w is critical to simulate realistic cirrus properties.},

Existing global climate studies rarely consider such patterns from non-parametric statistical standpoint. Here, we employ a non-parametric analysis framework to analyze seasonal hydroclimatic regimes by classifying global land regions into nine regimes using late 20th century precipitation means and seasonality. These regimes are used to assess implications for water availability due to concomitant changes in mean and seasonal precipitation and evaporation changes using CMIP5 model future climate projections. Out of 9 regimes, 4 show increased precipitation variation, while 5 show decreased evaporation variation coupled with increasing mean precipitation and evaporation. Increases in projected seasonal precipitation variation in already highly variable precipitation regimes gives rise to a pattern of “seasonally variable regimes becoming more variable”. Regimes with low seasonality in precipitation, instead, experience increased wet season precipitation. Adequate water availability is key to human and ecosystem sustainability. Here, the authors show that seasonally variable regimes become more variable, and the combined influence of seasonality and magnitude of climate variables will affect future water availability.},

abstract = {Precipitation minus evaporation over continents is the freshwater flux which can be sustainably exploited by mankind. Over a catchment and longer time periods, this flux is also the amount of water which flows into the ocean. An essential question for semi-arid areas of the world is how well this freshwater flux can be estimated and predicted to evolve under climate change and human water use. Knowing this flux is thus an essential element in regional water resources management. Here we examine this question over the catchment of the Mediterranean Sea. Using a novel data assimilation methodology that incorporates observed discharges of rivers in a land surface model, new estimates of the freshwater flux to the Mediterranean Sea for the period 1980–2013 are proposed. We find that more freshwater (40–60%) flows into the sea than previously estimated. The hypothesis we advance is that previous estimates have underestimated the discharges of the large number of unmonitored coastal basins and neglected submarine ground water flows. The proposed error bars on the estimate indicate that the degrading river gauging station network limits our ability to monitor this branch of the water cycle reliably. Nevertheless, the uncertainty is small enough to allow the identification of regions in which non-climatic decreases in the freshwater flows exist over the period.},

abstract = {The southern border of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the most sensitive areas to deforestation in Brazil. Pondering problems related to changes in land use, new issues are emerging, such as, climate change and its negative effects on the regional hydrological cycle. The higher frequency of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a seems to have strong influence on rainfall in Amazonia. They are becoming more lasting and intense in the course of the last 20 to 30 years compared to the past 100 years. This paper may confront the scientific knowledge of the relations of climate and water resources in Amazon with the points of vulnerability that anthropic societies present in the region. The impact of climate change is not uniformly borne by different regions and populations. Actually, individuals, sectors and systems are affected to varying degrees and, besides, they may be prejudiced to a greater or lesser extent. These impacts vary in magnitude and intensity in accordance with certain aspects, for instance, geographical location, time, the prevalent social, economic and environmental conditions and the infra-structure of a given location. A comprehensive description of these extreme climate events is one of the first steps to a regional vulnerability approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {A global river discharge simulation was conducted that accounted for 452 individually operated reservoirs by locating them on the digital global river network map of TRIP, a global river routing model. An operating rule was determined for each reservoir using a newly-developed algorithm that used currently available global data such as reservoir storage capacity, intended purposes, simulated inflow, and water demand in the lower reaches. This algorithm reduced the root mean square error of reservoir release and river discharge simulations from that of earlier global river discharge simulations that neglected reservoir operations or substituted an algorithm for natural-lake outflow. The 2-year global simulation results indicate that reservoir operations substantially altered monthly discharge for individual basins (i.e., by more than 20%). Averaged over the continental scale, the maximum change in monthly river discharge varied from 0% to 34% and the changes in reservoir storage were small as a proportion of the total storage capacity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this article, I explore the evolving historical views of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle through a lens that might be called ‘a model of balance.' The notion of balance in western literature, seems to me to capture a central theme for how scholars of natural history, medieval mathematicians, designers of scientific instruments, and early waterworks engineers viewed the complexities and evaluated the evidence for how water moves in the terrestrial landscape. Using historical images and text, this study attempts to document how we arrived at the modern interpretation, its sources, origins, and relationships within the terrestrial earth. By comparing ancient models for the hydrologic cycle one can begin to construct a plausible story of its evolution as well as the important actors. I pay particular attention to the origins and sources of springs, rivers, and groundwater, the kinds of evidence proposed, and its relation to the sense of balance that emerges. Finally, I argue that at by the end of the 18th and into the early 19th century, the modern view of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle that emerged became a necessary foundation for the geophysical, ecological, and cultural Earth science themes that still flourish today.},

For this purpose, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to all of these types of GRACE-based solutions to extract the corresponding main orthogonal spatial and temporal modes of variability to be compared for 2003-2010. For the first three spatial modes, regional solutions provide a better geographical localization of hydrological structures, especially indicating major surface and groundwater systems of South America. Over hydrological patterns, records of river level versus time are particularly consistent with the GRACE temporal modes, especially for our regional solutions (. i.e., correlations generally greater than 0.7). Interannual variations of GRACE-based Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) clearly exhibit the signatures of extreme climatic events as the recent droughts and floods that affected South America. Very significant agreement is also found at interannual time-scale between TWS and discharges in drainage basins dominated by the surface reservoir (more than 0.9 of correlation in the Amazon basin).{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT We review geological evidence on the origin of the modern transcontinental Amazon River, and the paleogeographic history of riverine connections among the principal sedimentary basins of northern South America through the Neogene. Data are reviewed from new geochronological datasets using radiogenic and stable isotopes, and from traditional geochronological methods, including sedimentology, structural mapping, sonic and seismic logging, and biostratigraphy. The modern Amazon River and the continental-scale Amazon drainage basin were assembled during the late Miocene and Pliocene, via some of the largest purported river capture events in Earth history. Andean sediments are first recorded in the Amazon Fan at about 10.1-9.4 Ma, with a large increase in sedimentation at about 4.5 Ma. The transcontinental Amazon River therefore formed over a period of about 4.9-5.6 million years, by means of several river capture events. The origins of the modern Amazon River are hypothesized to be linked with that of mega-wetland landscapes of tropical South America (e.g. v{\'{a}}rzeas, pantanals, seasonally flooded savannahs). Mega-wetlands have persisted over about 10% northern South America under different configurations for >15 million years. Although the paleogeographic reconstructions presented are simplistic and coarse-grained, they are offered to inspire the collection and analysis of new sedimentological and geochronological datasets.RESUMO Este trabalho {\'{e}} uma revis{\~{a}}o das evid{\^{e}}ncias geol{\'{o}}gicas sobre a origem do moderno rio Amazonas transcontinental, e a hist{\'{o}}ria paleogeogr{\'{a}}fica das conex{\~{o}}es ribeirinhas entre as principais bacias sedimentares do norte da Am{\'{e}}rica do Sul durante o Ne{\'{o}}geno.

abstract = {The WAter Cycle Multi-mission Observation Strategy - EvapoTranspiration (WACMOS-ET) project has compiled a forcing data set covering the period 2005-2007 that aims to maximize the exploitation of European Earth Observations data sets for evapotranspiration (ET) estimation. The data set was used to run four established ET algorithms: the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL), the Penman-Monteith algorithm from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evaporation product (PM-MOD), the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). In addition, in situ meteorological data from 24 FLUXNET towers were used to force the models, with results from both forcing sets compared to tower-based flux observations. Model performance was assessed on several timescales using both sub-daily and daily forcings. The PT-JPL model and GLEAM provide the best performance for both satellite- and tower-based forcing as well as for the considered temporal resolutions. Simulations using the PM-MOD were mostly underestimated, while the SEBS performance was characterized by a systematic overestimation. In general, all four algorithms produce the best results in wet and moderately wet climate regimes. In dry regimes, the correlation and the absolute agreement with the reference tower ET observations were consistently lower. While ET derived with in situ forcing data agrees best with the tower measurements (R2=0.67), the agreement of the satellite-based ET estimates is only marginally lower (R2=0.58). Results also show similar model performance at daily and sub-daily (3-hourly) resolutions. Overall, our validation experiments against in situ measurements indicate that there is no single best-performing algorithm across all biome and forcing types. An extension of the evaluation to a larger selection of 85 towers (model inputs resampled to a common grid to facilitate global estimates) confirmed the original findings.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in land surfacemodeling and remote sensing, estimates of the global water budget are still fairly uncertain. This study aims to evaluate the water budget of the Amazon basin based on several state-ofthe- art land surface model (LSM) outputs. Water budget variables (terrestrial water storage TWS, evapotranspiration ET, surface runoff R, and base flow B) are evaluated at the basin scale using both remote sensing and in situ data. Meteorological forcings at a 3-hourly time step and 18 spatial resolution were used to run 14 LSMs. Precipitation datasets that have been rescaled to matchmonthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) andGlobal Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) datasets and the daily Hydrologie du Bassin de l'Amazone (HYBAM) dataset were used to perform three experiments. The Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP) river routing scheme was forced with R and B and simulated discharges are compared against observations at 165 gauges. Simulated ET and TWS are compared against FLUXNET and MOD16A2 evapotranspiration datasets andGravity Recovery and ClimateExperiment (GRACE)TWSestimates in two subcatchments of main tributaries (Madeira and Negro Rivers).At the basin scale, simulated ET ranges from 2.39 to 3.26mmday-1 and a low spatial correlation between ET and precipitation indicates that evapotranspiration does not depend on water availability over most of the basin. Results also show that other simulated water budget components vary significantly as a function of both the LSM and precipitation dataset, but simulated TWS generally agrees with GRACE estimates at the basin scale. The best water budget simulations resulted from experiments using HYBAM, mostly explained by a denser rainfall gauge network and the rescaling at a finer temporal scale.},

GRACE provided a first global observational record of water mass redistribution at spatial scales greater than 63000 km2. This limits their usability in regional hydrological applications. In this study, we implement a statistical downscaling approach that assimilates 0.5° × 0.5° water storage fields from the WaterGAP hydrology model (WGHM), precipitation fields from 3 models, evapotranspiration and runoff from 2 models, with GRACE data to obtain TWSC at a 0.5° × 0.5° grid. The downscaled product exploits dominant common statistical modes between all the hydrological datasets to improve the spatial resolution of GRACE. We also provide open access to scripts that researchers can use to produce downscaled TWSC fields with input observations and models of their own choice.

abstract = {This study investigated the potential of assessing the water balance in South America, at multiple scales, using satellite remote sensing precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets, terrestrial water storage changes from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and discharge measurements. The remote sensing precipitation datasets included those of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), whilst the ET constituents included the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). Uncertainties in precipitation and ET were evaluated using in situ measurements of 307 rain-gauge stations and 16 eddy covariance sites, respectively. The water balance closure and uncertainties were evaluated in 50 basins for the period 2003–2014, at different spatial scales and under different climatic conditions. Overall, MSWEP precipitation and GLEAM ET provided fewer uncertainties, whilst TRMM and MOD16 yielded greater bias and more errors. Better agreements between the TWSC from GRACE and the water balance were found in the large and medium-sized basins, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 42%, whilst small basins and those located in regions with subtropical humid climates, where precipitation did not present strong seasonality, had a RMSE around 130%, indicating that climate conditions can influence the water balance closure. The TWSC from GRACE and the remote sensing water balance estimations were in agreement for more than half of the evaluated basins, mainly those located in tropical climate regions. Greater bias and more errors were found in the estimations of discharge in the semi-arid basins, with low runoff coefficients. Despite the water balance based on remote sensing estimations remaining a challenge due to the large uncertainties in precipitation, ET, and TWSC, our results showed their great potential for assessing terrestrial water-cycle dynamics and understanding their spatial and temporal variability at multiple scales.},

Sources of error in diagnostic computation can arise from the use of numerical methods different from those used in the atmosphere model, the time and vertical resolution of the archived data, and data availability. These sources of error are assessed using the climatological moisture balance in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) that archives vertically integrated moisture fluxes and convergence. The largest single source of error arises from the diagnostic evaluation of divergence. The chosen second-order accurate centered finite difference scheme applied to the actual vertically integrated moisture fluxes leads to significant differences from the ERA-Interim reported moisture convergence. Using daily data, instead of 6-hourly data, leads to an underestimation of the patterns of moisture divergence and convergence by midlatitude transient eddies. A la...},

abstract = {The Amazon basin is experiencing rapid forest loss and fragmentation. Fragmented forests are more prone than intact forests to periodic damage from El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) droughts, which cause elevated tree mortality, increased litterfall, shifts in plant phenology, and other ecological changes, especially near forest edges. Moreover, positive feedbacks among forest loss, fragmentation, fire, and regional climate change appear increasingly likely. Deforestation reduces plant evapotranspiration, which in turn constrains regional rainfall, increasing the vulnerability of forests to fire. Forest fragments are especially vulnerable because they have dry, fire-prone edges, are logged frequently, and often are adjoined by cattle pastures, which are burned regularly. The net result is that there may be a critical "deforestation threshold" above which Amazonian rainforests can no longer be sustained, particularly in relatively seasonal areas of the basin. Global warming could exacerbate this problem if it promotes drier climates or stronger ENSO droughts. Synergisms among many simultaneous environmental changes are posing unprecedented threats to Amazonian forests.},

abstract = {Band selection, as a special case of the feature selection problem, tries to remove redundant bands and select a few important bands to represent the whole image cube. This has attracted much attention since the selected bands provide discriminative information for further applications and reduce the computational burden. Though hyperspectral band selection has gained rapid development in recent years, it is still a challenging task because of the following requirements: 1) An effective model can capture the underlying relations between different high-dimensional spectral bands. 2) A fast and robust measure function can adapt to general hyperspectral tasks. 3) An efficient search strategy can find the desired selected bands in reasonable computational time. To satisfy these requirements, a multigraph determinantal point process (MDPP) model is proposed to capture the full structure between different bands and efficiently find the optimal band subset in extensive hyperspectral applications. There are three main contributions: 1) Graphical model is naturally transferred to address band selection problem by the proposed MDPP. 2) Multiple graphs are designed to capture the intrinsic relationships between hyperspectral bands. 3) Mixture determinantal point process (Mix-DPP) is proposed to model the multiple dependencies in the proposed multiple graphs, and offers an efficient search strategy to select the optimal bands. To verify the superiority of the proposed method, experiments have been conducted on three hyperspectral applications, such as hyperspectral classification, anomaly detection, and target detection. The reliability of the proposed method in generic hyperspectral tasks is experimentally proved on four real-world hyperspectral data sets.},

The development of new concepts and prototypes as well as the optimization and the way of insertion of passive and active implants is facilitated by carrying out virtual tests. Mechanical models of spatial structures of the middle car and its adjacent regions are established by applying multibody systems and finite element modeling approach. In particular, the nonlinear behavior of the elements is taken into account. For the determination of parameters such as coupling parameters in reconstructed cars, measurements using Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) were carried out. The governing differential equations of motion allow the investigation of transient and steady state behavior by time integration and frequency domain methods. Optimization methods can be applied for determination of design parameters such as coupling stiffness and damping, the characteristics of actuator, the position of attachment and direction of actuation. Mechanical models enable non-invasive interpretation of dynamical behavior based on measurements such as LDV from umbo or multifrequency tympanometry. It is shown: The transfer behavior is depending on static pressures in the car canal, tympanic cavity or cochlea. For reconstructed ears, the coupling conditions are governing the sound transfer substantially. Due to restricted coupling forces, the excitation of inner ear is limited and the sound transfer is distorted. Other sources of distortion are nonlinear coupling mechanisms. In reconstructions with active implants, the actuator excites the microphone whereby feedback effects may occur.},

The performance of the resulting fast and accurate inverse radiative transfer model is presented for a large diversified dataset of radiosonde atmospheres that includes rare events.

abstract = {Tropical river basins are experiencing major hydrological alterations as a result of climate variability and deforestation. These drivers of flow changes are often difficult to isolate in large basins based on either observations or experiments; however, combining these methods with numerical models can help identify the contribution of climate and deforestation to hydrological alterations. This paper presents a study carried out in the Tapajόs River (Brazil), a 477,000 km2 basin in South-eastern Amazonia, in which we analysed the role of annual land cover change on daily river flows. Analysis of observed spatial and temporal trends in rainfall, forest cover, and river flow metrics for 1976 to 2008 indicates a significant shortening of the wet season and reduction in river flows through most of the basin despite no significant trend in annual precipitation. Coincident with seasonal trends over the past 4 decades, over 35% of the original forest (140,000 out of 400,000 km2) was cleared. In order to determine the effects of land clearing and rainfall variability to trends in river flows, we conducted hindcast simulations with ED2 + R, a terrestrial biosphere model incorporating fine scale ecosystem heterogeneity arising from annual land-use change and linked to a flow routing scheme. The simulations indicated basin-wide increases in dry season flows caused by land cover transitions beginning in the early 1990s when forest cover dropped to 80% of its original extent. Simulations of historical potential vegetation in the absence of land cover transitions indicate that reduction in rainfall during the dry season (mean of −9 mm per month) would have had an opposite and larger magnitude effect than deforestation (maximum of +4 mm/month), leading to the overall net negative trend in river flows. In light of the expected increase in future climate variability and water infrastructure development in the Amazon and other tropical basins, this study presents an approach for analysing how multiple drivers of change are altering regional hydrology and water resources management.},

This model includes the mass and energy balance at the land surface; three-dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow; explicit representation of the water table; and overland flow. The model is applied to the Little Washita watershed in Central Oklahoma, USA and compared to runoff, soil moisture and energy flux observations. The connection between groundwater dynamics and the land surface energy balance is studied using a variety of conventional and spatial statistical measures. For a number of energy variables a strong interconnection is demonstrated with water table depth. This connection varies seasonally and spatially depending on the spatial composition of water table depth. A theoretical critical water table depth range is presented where a strong sensitivity between groundwater and land-surface processes may be observed. For this particular watershed, a critical depth range is established between 1 and 5 m in which the land surface energy budget is most sensitive to groundwater storage. Finally, concrete recommendations are put forth to characterize this interconnection in the field. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

In the absence of balance constraints, various combinations of modern flux datasets reveal that current estimates of net radiation into Earth's surface exceed corresponding turbulent heat fluxes by 13–24 W m−2. The largest imbalances occur over oceanic regions where the component algorithms operate independent of closure constraints. Recent uncertainty assessments suggest that these imbalances fall within anticipated error bounds for each dataset, but the systematic nature of required adjustments across different regions confirm the existence of biases in the component fluxes.

abstract = {A new retrospective satellite-based precipitation dataset is constructed as a climate data record for hydrological and climate studies. Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) provides daily and 0.25° rainfall estimates for the latitude band 60°S-60°N for the period of 1 January 1983 to 31 December 2012 (delayed present). PERSIANN-CDR is aimed at addressing the need for a consistent, long-term, high-resolution, and global precipitation dataset for studying the changes and trends in daily precipitation, especially extreme precipitation events, due to climate change and natural variability. PERSIANN-CDR is generated from the PERSIANN algorithm using GridSat-B1 infrared data. It is adjusted using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly product to maintain consistency of the two datasets at 2.5° monthly scale throughout the entire record. Three case studies for testing the efficacy of the dataset against available observations and satellite products are reported. The verification study over Hurricane Katrina (2005) shows that PERSIANN-CDR has good agreement with the stage IV radar data, noting that PERSIANN-CDR has more complete spatial coverage than the radar data. In addition, the comparison of PERSIANN-CDR against gauge observations during the 1986 Sydney flood in Australia reaffirms the capability of PERSIANN-CDR to provide reasonably accurate rainfall estimates. Moreover, the probability density function (PDF) of PERSIANN-CDR over the contiguous United States exhibits good agreement with the PDFs of the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gridded gauge data and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product. The results indicate high potential for using PERSIANN-CDR for long-term hydroclimate studies in regional and global scales.},

abstract = {This study investigated the potential of assessing the water balance in South America, at multiple scales, using satellite remote sensing precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets, terrestrial water storage changes from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and discharge measurements. The remote sensing precipitation datasets included those of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), whilst the ET constituents included the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). Uncertainties in precipitation and ET were evaluated using in situ measurements of 307 rain-gauge stations and 16 eddy covariance sites, respectively. The water balance closure and uncertainties were evaluated in 50 basins for the period 2003–2014, at different spatial scales and under different climatic conditions. Overall, MSWEP precipitation and GLEAM ET provided fewer uncertainties, whilst TRMM and MOD16 yielded greater bias and more errors. Better agreements between the TWSC from GRACE and the water balance were found in the large and medium-sized basins, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 42%, whilst small basins and those located in regions with subtropical humid climates, where precipitation did not present strong seasonality, had a RMSE around 130%, indicating that climate conditions can influence the water balance closure. The TWSC from GRACE and the remote sensing water balance estimations were in agreement for more than half of the evaluated basins, mainly those located in tropical climate regions. Greater bias and more errors were found in the estimations of discharge in the semi-arid basins, with low runoff coefficients. Despite the water balance based on remote sensing estimations remaining a challenge due to the large uncertainties in precipitation, ET, and TWSC, our results showed their great potential for assessing terrestrial water-cycle dynamics and understanding their spatial and temporal variability at multiple scales.},

abstract = {Precipitation recycling is the contribution of evaporation within a region to precipitation in that same region. The recycling rate is a diagnostic measure of the potential for interactions between land surface hydrology and regional climate. In this paper we present a model for describing the seasonal and spatial variability of the recycling process. The precipitation recycling ratio, $\rho$, is the basic variable in describing the recycling process, $\rho$ is the fraction of precipitation at a certain location and time which is contributed by evaporation within the region under study. The recycling model is applied in studying the hydrologic cycle in the Amazon basin. It is estimated that about 25% of all the rain that falls in the Amazon basin is contributed by evaporation within the basin. This estimate is based on analysis of a data set supplied by the European Centre for Medium‐range Weather Forecasts. The same analysis is repeated using a different data set from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Based on this data set, the recycling ratio is estimated to be 35%. The seasonal variability of the recycling ratio is small compared with the yearly average. The new estimates of the recycling ratio are compared with results of previous studies, and the differences are explained. Copyright {\textcopyright}1994 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {[1] Modeling the routing of flood waters across large floodplains is challenging because flows respond to dynamic hydraulic controls from complex geomorphology, vegetation, and multiple water sources. In this study, we analyzed the topographic and hydrologic controls of inundation dynamics of a large floodplain unit (2440 km 2) along the lower Amazon River. We combined land topography derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) with underwater topography derived from an extensive echo-sounding survey to generate a seamless digital elevation model (DEM). Floodplain inundation was simulated using LISFLOOD-FP, which combines one-dimensional river routing with two-dimensional overland flow, and a local hydrological model. For the first time, accurate simulation of filling and drainage of an Amazon floodplain was achieved with quantification of changes in water elevation, flooding extent, and river-floodplain exchange. We examined the role of diffuse overbank versus channelized flows on river-floodplain exchange. Diffuse overbank flows represent 93% of total river to floodplain discharge and 54% of floodplain to river discharge. Floodplain discharge during high-water was four times higher than field observation values when the SRTM v.4 DEM with no correction was used for simulation because of a 24.4 m elevation bias originating from residual motion errors of the SRTM interferometric baseline.

These products generally merge geostationary infrared data and polar-orbiting passive microwave data to take advantage of the frequent sampling of the infrared and the superior quality of the microwave. The Program to Evaluate High Resolution Precipitation Products (PEHRPP) was established to evaluate and intercompare these datasets at a variety of spatial and temporal resolutions with the intent of guiding dataset developers and informing the user community regarding the error characteristics of the products.

abstract = {The impact of a changing climate on the Amazon basin is a subject of intensive research because of its rich biodiversity and the significant role of rainforests in carbon cycling. Climate change has also a direct hydrological impact, and increasing efforts have focused on understanding the hydrological dynamics at continental and subregional scales, such as the Western Amazon. New projections from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 ensemble indicate consistent climatic warming and increasing seasonality of precipitation in the Peruvian Amazon basin. Here we use a distributed land surface model to quantify the potential impact of this change in the climate on the hydrological regime of the upper Amazon river. Using extreme value analysis, historical and future projections of the annual minimum, mean, and maximum river flows are produced for a range of return periods between 1 and 100 yr. We show that the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios of climate change project an increased severity of the wet season flood pulse (7.5% and 12% increases respectively for the 100 yr return floods). These findings agree with previously projected increases in high extremes under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios climate projections, and are important to highlight due to the potential consequences on reproductive processes of in-stream species, swamp forest ecology, and socio-economy in the floodplain, amidst a growing literature that more strongly emphasises future droughts and their impact on the viability of the rainforest system over greater Amazonia.},

abstract = {Data obtained from NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites were used to investigate the relationships between topography, large-scale circulation, and the climatology of precipitation and cloudiness in the Andes - specifically over Peru and the Altiplano Plateau - at diurnal, seasonal, and interannual time scales. The spatial variability of cloudiness was assessed through empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of GOES brightness temperatures. Results indicate that landform is the principal agent of the space-time variability of moist atmospheric processes in the Andes, with the first mode explaining up to 70% of all observed variability. These results substantiate the differences between "continental" (Andes and Himalayas) and "maritime" (Western Cordillera) orographic precipitation regimes, reflecting the degree to which upwind landmasses modulate moisture transport toward and across mountain barriers. GOES brightness temperatures show that afternoon convective activity during the rainy season is more intense on wet hydrometeorological years such as 2001, whereas the space-time structure of nighttime cloudiness at the foothills and outlets of deep interior valleys does not change during the monsoon and from one year to another independently of large-scale conditions. This suggests that daytime cloud formation and precipitation is strongly dependent on large-scale moisture transport. Interactions between mesoscale and ridge-valley circulations, which are locked to the topography, determine the space-time organization of clouds and precipitation at nighttime. This leads to strong clustering of precipitation features associated with enhanced convection at high elevations along the ridges and near the headwaters of the major river systems in the TRMM data. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a new set of equations derived from 1D shallow water theory for use in 2D storage cell inundation models where flows in the x and y Cartesian directions are decoupled. The new equation set is designed to be solved explicitly at very low computational cost, and is here tested against a suite of four test cases of increasing complexity. In each case the predicted water depths compare favourably to analytical solutions or to simulation results from the diffusive storage cell code of Hunter et al. (2005). For the most complex test involving the fine spatial resolution simulation of flow in a topographically complex urban area the Root Mean Squared Difference between the new formulation and the model of Hunter et al. is $\sim$1cm. However, unlike diffusive storage cell codes where the stable time step scales with (1/$\Delta$x)2, the new equation set developed here represents shallow water wave propagation and so the stability is controlled by the Courant-Freidrichs-Lewy condition such that the stable time step instead scales with 1/$\Delta$x. This allows use of a stable time step that is 1-3 orders of magnitude greater for typical cell sizes than that possible with diffusive storage cell models and results in commensurate reductions in model run times. For the tests reported in this paper the maximum speed up achieved over a diffusive storage cell model was 1120×, although the actual value seen will depend on model resolution and water surface gradient. Solutions using the new equation set are shown to be grid-independent for the conditions considered and to have an intuitively correct sensitivity to friction, however small instabilities and increased errors on predicted depth were noted when Manning's n=0.01. The new equations are likely to find widespread application in many types of flood inundation modelling and should provide a useful additional tool, alongside more established model formulations, for a variety of flood risk management studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

However, SH signals are degraded by measurement and leakage errors. Mascon solutions (the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) release, herein) exhibit weakened signals at submascon resolutions. Both solutions require a scale factor examined by the CLM4.0 model to obtain the actual water storage signal. The Slepian localization method can avoid the SH leakage errors when applied to the basin scale. In this study, we estimate SH errors and scale factors for African hydrological regimes. Then, terrestrial water storage (TWS) in Africa is determined based on Slepian localization and compared with JPL-mascon and SH solutions. The three TWS estimates show good agreement for the TWS of large-sized and humid regimes but present discrepancies for the TWS of medium and small-sized regimes. Slepian localization is an effective method for deriving the TWS of arid zones. The TWS behavior in African regimes and its spatiotemporal variations are then examined. The negative TWS trends in the lower Nile and Sahara at -1.08 and -6.92 Gt/year, respectively, are higher than those previously reported.},

A previous estimate was\ngenerated for 1993-2008 using TOPEX-Poseidon, ERS-2 and ENVISAT, and is\nnow extended using Jason-2. To take full advantages of the new\navailability of in situ rating curves, the processing scheme is adapted\nand the adjustments of the methodology are discussed here. First, using\na large sample of in situ river height measurements, we estimate the\nstandard error of Jason-2-derived water levels over the Ganga and the\nBrahmaputra to be respectively of 0.28 m and 0.19 m, or less than\nsimilar to 4% of the annual peak-to-peak variations of these two\nrivers. Using the in situ rating curves between water levels and river\ndischarges, we show that Jason-2 accurately infers Ganga and Brahmaputra\ninstantaneous discharges for 2008-2011 with mean errors ranging from\nsimilar to 2180 m(3)/s (6.5%) over the Brahmaputra to similar to 1458\nm(3)/s (13%) over the Ganga. The combined Ganga-Brahmaputra monthly\ndischarges meet the requirements of acceptable accuracy (15-20%) with a\nmean error of similar to 16% for 2009-2011 and similar to 17% for\n1993-2011. The Ganga-Brahmaputra monthly discharge at the river mouths\nis then presented, showing a marked interannual variability with a\nstandard deviation of similar to 12500 m(3)/s, much larger than the data\nset uncertainty.

abstract = {This paper describes how the articles in this special issue support the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) priorities with a specific focus on the advancement of hydrometeorological sciences. It explores how hydrometeorological research has been used to improve process understanding and forecast models, provide datasets for model validation, and support water resource applications. In particular, in this collection of papers, the water balance is considered at both global and watershed scales. In this process the limitations of reanalysis products and inputs to hydrologic models are identified. Some of these limitations arise from the lack of understanding of orographic processes and the best way to incorporate them into models. Several modeling studies reported in this special issue address different aspects of the role of topography in land–atmosphere interaction over mountain systems including the mountains in Asia and North America. Other land processes are considered as well including soil and vegetation processes. A limitation in these modeling studies arises from issues related to model initialization and validation data. One precipitation paper in this collection considers the information on extreme precipitation events that can be extracted from these data while another reports on a new algorithm for observing light rain and drizzle events. As phase II of GEWEX progresses, more emphasis will be placed on the use of GEWEX products to explore climate science questions related to the global energy and water cycle and its applications. Some areas of opportunity for future GEWEX activities include the development of high-resolution integrated products, flux estimates from satellites, and open processes (or test beds) for product improvement.},

abstract = {<p>Abstract. Deforestation in Amazon is expected to decrease evapotranspiration (ET) and to increase soil moisture and river discharge under prevailing energy-limited conditions. The magnitude and sign of the response of ET to deforestation depend both on the magnitude and regional patterns of land-cover change (LCC), as well as on climate change and CO2 levels. On the one hand, elevated CO2 decreases leaf-scale transpiration, but this effect could be offset by increased foliar area density. Using three regional LCC scenarios specifically established for the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon, we investigate the impacts of climate change and deforestation on the surface hydrology of the Amazon Basin for this century, taking 2009 as a reference. For each LCC scenario, three land surface models (LSMs), LPJmL-DGVM, INLAND-DGVM and ORCHIDEE, are forced by bias-corrected climate simulated by three general circulation models (GCMs) of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). On average, over the Amazon Basin with no deforestation, the GCM results indicate a temperature increase of 3.3 °C by 2100 which drives up the evaporative demand, whereby precipitation increases by 8.5 %, with a large uncertainty across GCMs. In the case of no deforestation, we found that ET and runoff increase by 5.0 and 14 %, respectively. However, in south-east Amazonia, precipitation decreases by 10 % at the end of the dry season and the three LSMs produce a 6 % decrease of ET, which is less than precipitation, so that runoff decreases by 22 %. For instance, the minimum river discharge of the Rio Tapaj{\'{o}}s is reduced by 31 % in 2100. To study the additional effect of deforestation, we prescribed to the LSMs three contrasted LCC scenarios, with a forest decline going from 7 to 34 % over this century. All three scenarios partly offset the climate-induced increase of ET, and runoff increases over the entire Amazon. In the south-east, however, deforestation amplifies the decrease of ET at the end of dry season, leading to a large increase of runoff (up to +27 % in the extreme deforestation case), offsetting the negative effect of climate change, thus balancing the decrease of low flows in the Rio Tapaj{\'{o}}s. These projections are associated with large uncertainties, which we attribute separately to the differences in LSMs, GCMs and to the uncertain range of deforestation. At the subcatchment scale, the uncertainty range on ET changes is shown to first depend on GCMs, while the uncertainty of runoff projections is predominantly induced by LSM structural differences. By contrast, we found that the uncertainty in both ET and runoff changes attributable to uncertain future deforestation is low.</p>},

abstract = {<p>Abstract. Evapotranspiration (ET) of Amazon forests is a main driver of regional climate patterns and an important indicator of ecosystem functioning. Despite its importance, the seasonal variability of ET over Amazon forests, and its relationship with environmental drivers, is still poorly understood. In this study, we carry out a water balance approach to analyse seasonal patterns in ET and their relationships with water and energy drivers over five sub-basins across the Amazon Basin. We used in situ measurements of river discharge, and remotely sensed estimates of terrestrial water storage, rainfall, and solar radiation. We show that the characteristics of ET seasonality in all sub-basins differ in timing and magnitude. The highest mean annual ET was found in the northern Rio Negro basin (∼ 1497 mm year−1) and the lowest values in the Solim{\~{o}}es River basin (∼ 986 mm year−1). For the first time in a basin-scale study, using observational data, we show that factors limiting ET vary across climatic gradients in the Amazon, confirming local-scale eddy covariance studies. Both annual mean and seasonality in ET are driven by a combination of energy and water availability, as neither rainfall nor radiation alone could explain patterns in ET. In southern basins, despite seasonal rainfall deficits, deep root water uptake allows increasing rates of ET during the dry season, when radiation is usually higher than in the wet season. We demonstrate contrasting ET seasonality with satellite greenness across Amazon forests, with strong asynchronous relationships in ever-wet watersheds, and positive correlations observed in seasonally dry watersheds. Finally, we compared our results with estimates obtained by two ET models, and we conclude that neither of the two tested models could provide a consistent representation of ET seasonal patterns across the Amazon.</p>},

abstract = {The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), is the latest atmospheric reanalysis of the modern satellite era produced by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). MERRA-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, MERRA, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond MERRA's terminus. While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015. MERRA-2 products are accessible online through the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC).},

abstract = {Recent efforts have sought to estimate river discharge and other surface water-related quantities using spaceborne sensors, with better spatial coverage but worse temporal sampling as compared with in situ measurements. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will provide river discharge estimates globally from space. However, questions on how to optimally use the spatially distributed but asynchronous satellite observations to generate continuous fields still exist. This paper presents a statistical model (River Kriging-RK), for estimating discharge time series in a river network in the context of the SWOT mission. RK uses discharge estimates at different locations and times to produce a continuous field using spatiotemporal kriging. A key component of RK is the space-time river discharge covariance, which was derived analytically from the diffusive wave approximation of Saint Venant's equations. The RK covariance also accounts for the loss of correlation at confluences. The model performed well in a case study on Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) River system in Bangladesh using synthetic SWOT observations. The correlation model reproduced empirically derived values. RK (R2=0.83) outperformed other kriging-based methods (R2=0.80), as well as a simple time series linear interpolation (R2=0.72). RK was used to combine discharge from SWOT and in situ observations, improving estimates when the latter is included (R2=0.91). The proposed statistical concepts may eventually provide a feasible framework to estimate continuous discharge time series across a river network based on SWOT data, other altimetry missions, and/or in situ data.},

abstract = {How useful are satellite-based rainfall estimates (SRFE) as forcing data for hydrological applications? Which SRFE should be favoured for hydrological modelling? What could researchers do to increase the performance of SRFE-driven hydrological simulations? To address these three research questions, four SRFE (CMORPH, RFE 2.0, TRMM-3B42 and PERSIANN) and one re-analysis product (ERA-Interim) are evaluated within a hydrological application for the time period 2003-2008, over two river basins (Volta and Baro-Akobo) which hold distinct physiographic, climatologic and hydrologic conditions. The focus was on the assessment of: (a) the individual and combined effect of SRFE-specific calibration and bias correction on the hydrological performance, (b) the level of complexity required regarding bias correction and interpolation to achieve a good hydrological performance, and (c) the hydrological performance of SRFE during high- and low-flow conditions. Results show that (1) the hydrological performance is always higher if the model is calibrated to the respective SRFE rather than to interpolated ground observations; (2) for SRFE that are afflicted with bias, a bias-correction step prior to SRFE-specific calibration is essential, while for SRFE with good intrinsic data quality applying only a SRFE-specific model calibration is sufficient; (3) the more sophisticated bias-correction method used in this work (histogram equalization) results generally in a superior hydrological performance, while a more sophisticated spatial interpolation method (Kriging with External Drift) seems to be of added value only over mountainous regions; (4) the bias correction is not over-proportionally important over mountainous catchments, as it solely depends on where the SRFE show high biases (e.g. for PERSIANN and CMORPH over lowland areas); and (5) the hydrological performance during high-flow conditions is superior thus promoting the use of SRFE for applications focusing on the high-end flow spectrum. These results complement a preliminary "ground truthing" phase and provide insight on the usefulness of SRFE for hydrological modelling and under which conditions they can be used with a given level of reliability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {On the Tibetan Plateau, the limited ground-based rainfall information owing to a harsh environment has brought great challenges to hydrological studies. Satellite-based rainfall products, which allow for a better coverage than both radar network and rain gauges on the Tibetan Plateau, can be suitable alternatives for studies on investigating the hydrological processes and climate change. In this study, a newly developed daily satellite-based precipitation product, termed Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), is used as input for a hydrologic model to simulate streamflow in the upper Yellow and Yangtze River basins on the Tibetan Plateau. The results show that the simulated streamflows using PERSIANN-CDR precipitation and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) precipitation are closer to observation than that using limited gauge-based precipitation interpolation in the upper Yangtze River basin. The simulated streamflow using gauge-based precipitation are higher than the streamflow observation during the wet season. In the upper Yellow River basin, gauge-based precipitation, GLDAS precipitation, and PERSIANN-CDR precipitation have similar good performance in simulating streamflow. The evaluation of streamflow simulation capability in this study partly indicates that the PERSIANN-CDR rainfall product has good potential to be a reliable dataset and an alternative information source of a limited gauge network for conducting long-term hydrological and climate studies on the Tibetan Plateau.},

abstract = {Assessing the risk of a historical-level flood is essential for regional flood protection and resilience establishment. However, due to the limited spatiotemporal coverage of observations, the impact assessment relies on model simulations and is thus subject to uncertainties from cascade physical processes. This study assesses the flood hazard map with uncertainties subject to different combinations of runoff inputs, variables for flood frequency analysis and fitting distributions based on estimations by the CaMa-Flood global hydrodynamic model. Our results show that deviation in the runoff inputs is the most influential source of uncertainties in the estimated flooded water depth and inundation area, contributing more than 80 % of the total uncertainties investigated in this study. Global and regional inundation maps for floods with 1-in-100 year return periods show large uncertainty values but small uncertainty ratios for river channels and lakes, while the opposite results are found for dry zones and mountainous regions. This uncertainty is a result of increasing variation at tails among various fitting distributions. In addition, the uncertainty between selected variables is limited but increases from the regular period to the rarer floods, both for the water depth at points and for inundation area over regions. The uncertainties in inundation area also lead to uncertainties in estimating the population and economy exposure to the floods. In total, inundation accounts for 9.1 % [8.1 %-10.3 %] of the land area for a 1-in-100 year flood, leading to 13.4 % [12.1 %-15 %] of population exposure and 13.1 % [11.8 %-14.7 %] of economic exposure for the globe. The flood exposure and uncertainties vary by continent and the results in Africa have the largest uncertainty, probably due to the limited observations to constrain runoff simulations, indicating a necessity to improve the performance of different hydrological models especially for data-limited regions.},

abstract = {[Nimbus 7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) measurements at five frequencies in the region 6.6 to 37 GHz, at a resolution of 155 km, are analyzed to infer precipitation over the global oceans. The microwave data show, on this spatial scale, that the combined liquid water in the clouds and rain increases the brightness temperature almost linearly with frequency in the 6.6 to 18 GHz region, while at 37 GHz such a simple relationship is not noticed. Further, as the atmospheric water vapor absorption and the effects of scattering by precipitation particles are relatively weak at 6.6 and 10.7 GHz, a technique to remotely sense the liquid water content in the atmosphere is developed based on the brightness measurements at these two frequencies. Seasonal mean patterns of liquid water content in the atmosphere derived from SMMR over global oceans relate closely to climatological patterns of precipitation. Based on this, an empirical relationship is derived to estimate precipitation over the global oceans, with an accuracy of about ±30 percent, on a seasonal basis from satellite measurements made during the three years (1979–81) before the recent El Ni{\~{n}}o event. The deviations from these three-year means, in the precipitation, produced by the 1982–83 El Ni{\~{n}}o event are then deduced from the SMMR measurements. In the Pacific one notices from these deviations that the precipitation over the ITCZ in the north, the South Pacific Convergence Zone, and the oceans around Indonesia is drastically reduced. At the same time a substantial increase in precipitation is observed over the normally dry central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.]},

abstract = {Large rivers create major gaps in reef distribution along tropical shelves. The Amazon River represents 20% of the global riverine discharge to the ocean, generating up to a 1.3 × 106-km2 plume, and extensive muddy bottoms in the equatorial margin of South America. As a result, a wide area of the tropical North Atlantic is heavily affected in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation. Such unfavorable conditions were thought to imprint a major gap in Western Atlantic reefs. We present an extensive carbonate system off the Amazon mouth, underneath the river plume. Significant carbonate sedimentation occurred during lowstand sea level, and still occurs in the outer shelf, resulting in complex hard-bottom topography. A permanent near-bottom wedge of ocean water, together with the seasonal nature of the plume's eastward retroflection, conditions the existence of this extensive (∼9500 km2) hard-bottom mosaic. The Amazon reefs transition from accretive to erosional structures and encompass extensive rhodolith beds. Carbonate structures function as a connectivity corridor for wide depth-ranging reef-associated species, being heavily colonized by large sponges and other structure-forming filter feeders that dwell under low light and high levels of particulates. The oxycline between the plume and subplume is associated with chemoautotrophic and anaerobic microbial metabolisms. The system described here provides several insights about the responses of tropical reefs to suboptimal and marginal reef-building conditions, which are accelerating worldwide due to global changes.},

abstract = {<p>The river discharge plays an important role in earth's water cycles, but it is difficult to estimate due to un-gauged rivers, human activities, and measurement errors. One approach is based on the observed flux and a simple annual water balance model (ignoring human processes) for ungauged rivers, but it only provides annual mean values which is insufficient for oceanic modellings. Another way is by forcing a land surface model (LSM) with atmospheric conditions. It provides daily values but with uncertainties associated to models.<br><br> We use data assimilation techniques by merging the modelled river discharges by ORCHIDEE (without human processes currently) LSM and the observations from Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) to obtain optimized discharges over the entire basin. The <q>model systematic errors</q> and <q>human impacts</q> (e.g., dam operation, irrigation, etc.) are taken into account by an optimization parameter <i>x</i> (with annual variation), which is applied to correct model intermediate variables runoff and drainage over each sub-watershed. The method is illustrated over Iberian Peninsula with 27 GRDC stations over the period 1979&ndash;1989. ORCHDIEE represents a realistic discharge over north of Iberian Peninsula with small model systematic errors, while the model overestimates discharges by 30&thinsp;%&ndash;150&thinsp;% over south and northeast region where the blue water footprint is large. The bias (absolute value) has been significantly reduced to less than 30&thinsp;% after assimilation, and the assimilation result is not sensitive to assimilation strategies. This method also corrects the discharge bias for the basins without observations assimilated by extrapolating the correction from adjacent basins. The <q>correction</q> increases the inter-annual variability of river discharge because of the fluctuation of water usage. The <i>E</i> (<i>P</i>-<i>E</i>) of GLEAM (Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model, v3.1a) is lower (higher) than the bias corrected value, which could be due to the different <i>P</i> forcing and probably the missing processes in the GLEAM model.</p>},

abstract = {Tropical deforestation changes the surface energy balance and water cycle, but how much change occurs strongly depends on the land uses that follow deforestation. Here, we quantify how recent (2000-2010) transitions among widespread land uses (i.e., forests, croplands, and pastures) altered the water and energy balance in the Xingu region of southeast Amazonia. Spatial-temporal analyses of multiple satellite data sets revealed that forest-to-crop and forest-to-pasture transitions decreased the net surface radiation (by 18% and 12%, respectively) and latent heat flux (32% and 24%), while increasing sensible heat flux (6% and 9%). Land use transitions during the 2000s reduced contemporaneous evapotranspiration (ET) in the Xingu region by 35 km3 and warmed the land surface temperature (LST) by 0.3 °C. Forest-to-pasture and forest-to-crop transitions accounted for most of the observed ET reduction (25.5 km3 and 7 km3, respectively) and LST increase (0.2 °C and 0.07 °C). Pasture-to-crop transitions reduced ET by an additional 2.5 km3 and increased LST by 0.03 °C. If land use had changed at a similar rate within the region's protected areas, ET would have decreased by another 4.7 km3 and the surface would have warmed an additional 0.5 °C. Forests thus play a key role in regulating regional climate in Amazonia, with protected areas able to attenuate regional climate change caused by land use changes. Our findings show how a major non-GHG forcing, in this case agricultural expansion, has significantly altered regional climate in southeastern Amazonia and how protected forests can mitigate such changes.},

abstract = {This study extends the popular triple collocation method for error assessment from three source estimates to an arbitrary number of source estimates, i.e., to solve the "multiple" collocation problem. Past efforts on multiple collocation fall short of delivering a well-defined, well-interpreted and unique solution thus may result in inconsistent conclusions. Here the error assessment problem is solved through Pythagorean constraints in Hilbert space, which is slightly different from the original inner product solution but allows us to define a unique solution to the multiple collocation. The Pythagorean solution is fully equivalent to the original inner product solution for the triple collocation case. The multiple collocation turns out to be an over-constrained problem and a least squares solution is presented. As the most critical assumption of uncorrelated errors will surely fail in most multiple collocation problems, we propose to divide the source estimates into structural groups based on their production process and treat the structural and non-structural errors separately. Such error separation allows the source estimates to have their structural errors fully correlated within the same structural group, which is much more realistic than the original assumption. A new error assessment procedure is developed which performs the collocation twice, each for one type of errors (structural and non-structural), and then sums up the two types of errors. The new procedure is also fully backward compatible with the original triple collocation technique. Error assessment experiments are carried out for surface soil moisture data from multiple remote sensing models, land surface models, and in situ measurements.},

abstract = {We find that interferometric processing of repeat-pass L-HH-band shuttle imaging radar (SIR-C) data reveals centimeter-scale changes in the elevations of water surfaces within flooded vegetation. Because radar pulses reflect specularly from the water surface, interferometric observations of open water are incoherent. However, within flooded forests and inundated shrubs, the L-band radar pulse penetrates the vegetation canopy and follows a double-bounce travel path that includes the water and vegetation-trunk surfaces. In these environments, the returned radar energy and associated phase coherence are both stronger than the surrounding nonflooded terrain, permitting determination of the interferometric phase. Phase errors related to atmospheric water vapor are usually longer in wavelength and spatially distinct from phase signatures related to stage changes in tributaries and floodplain lakes. The interferometrically measured stage decreases match gauge data, providing further verification. Water level changes across 150 m to 2.75 km-wide water bodies containing inundated vegetation can be reliably measured. Our results suggest that if future interferometric L-HH-band SAR missions are implemented with short temporal baselines, it is possible to measure the hydrologic response of wetlands and inundated floodplains to changes in mainstem water level.},

abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is difficult to measure at the scales of climate models and climate variability. While satellite retrieval algorithms do exist, their accuracy is limited by the sparseness of in situ observations available for calibration and validation, which themselves may be unrepresentative of 500 m and larger scale satellite footprints and grid pixels. Here, we use a combination of satellite and ground-based observations to close the water budgets of seven continental scale river basins (Mackenzie, Fraser, Nelson, Mississippi, Tocantins, Danube, and Ubangi), estimating mean ET as a residual. For any river basin, ET must equal total precipitation minus net runoff minus the change in total terrestrial water storage (TWS), in order for mass to be conserved. We make use of precipitation from two global observation-based products, archived runoff data, and TWS changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. We demonstrate that while uncertainty in the water budget-based estimates of monthly ET is often too large for those estimates to be useful, the uncertainty in the mean annual cycle is small enough that it is practical for evaluating other ET products. Here, we evaluate five land surface model simulations, two operational atmospheric analyses, and a recent global reanalysis product based on our results. An important outcome is that the water budget-based ET time series in two tropical river basins, one in Brazil and the other in central Africa, exhibit a weak annual cycle, which may help to resolve debate about the strength of the annual cycle of ET in such regions and how ET is constrained throughout the year. The methods described will be useful for water and energy budget studies, weather and climate model assessments, and satellite-based ET retrieval optimization.

abstract = {Deforestation reduced forest cover in Brazil's Xingu River Basin (XB; area: 510,000km2) from 90% of the basin in the 1970s to 75% in the 2000s. Such large-scale land cover changes can substantially alter regional water budgets, but their influence can be difficult to isolate from that of natural climate variability. In this study, we estimate changes to the XB water balance from the 1970s to the 2000s due to climate variations and deforestation, using a combination of long-term observations of rainfall and discharge; satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration (MODIS) and surface water storage (GRACE); and numerical modeling estimates (IBIS) of water budget components (evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and discharge). Model simulations over this period suggest that climate variations alone accounted for a -82mm decrease (mean per unit area) in annual discharge (-14%, from 8190m3s-1 to 7806m3s-1), due to a -2% decrease in precipitation and +3% increase in evapotranspiration. Deforestation alone caused a +34mm increase in annual discharge (+6%), as a result of a -3% decrease in evapotranspiration and +1% increase in soil moisture across the XB. Climate variability and land cover change thus had opposite effects on the XB water balance, with climate effects masking deforestation-induced changes to the water budget. Protected areas, which cover 55% of the basin, have helped to mitigate the effects of past deforestation on water recycling in the Xingu. However, our results suggest that continued deforestation outside protected areas could trigger changes of sufficient magnitude to offset climate variability.},

abstract = {In this study, we tried to validate groundwater storage (GWS) anomaly obtained from a combination of GRACE and land-surface model based estimates, for the first time, with GWS anomaly obtained from a dense network of in-situ groundwater observation wells within 12 major river basins in India. We used seasonal data from >15,000 groundwater observation wells between 2005 and 2013, distributed all over the country. Two recently released GRACE products, RL05 spherical harmonics (SH) and RL05 mascon (MS) products are used for comparison with in-situ data. To our knowledge, this is the first study of comparing the performance of two independent GRACE products at a sub-continental scale. Also for the first time, we have created a high resolution (0.10 × 0.10) map of specific yield for the entire country that was used for calculating GWS. Observed GWS anomalies have been computed using water level anomalies and specific yield information for the locale of individual observation wells that are up-scaled to basin-scale in order to compare with GRACE-based estimates. In general GRACE-based estimates match well (on the basis of the statistical analyses performed in the study) with observed estimates in most of the river basins. On comparing with observed GWS anomaly, GRACE-SH estimates match well in terms of RMSE, while GRACE-MS estimates show better association in terms of correlation, while the output of skewness, kurtosis, coefficient of variation (CV) and scatter analyses remain inconclusive for inter-comparison between two GRACE estimates. We used a non-parametric trend estimation approach, the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, to further assess the performance of the two GRACE estimates. GRACE-MS estimates clearly outperform GRACE-SH estimates for reproducing observed GWS anomaly trends with significantly (>95% confidence level) strong association in 10 out of 12 basins for GRACE-MS estimates, on the other hand, GRACE-SH estimates show significantly (>95% confidence level) strong association in 6 out of 12 basins. On the basis of the study output, we recommend using GRACE-MS estimates for groundwater studies over the region and other regions of the globe with similar climatic, hydrogeologic or groundwater withdrawal conditions.},

IMERG was evaluated along with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) against 302 quality-controlled rain gauges across Ecuador and Peru. Detection, quantitative estimation statistics, and probability distribution functions are calculated at different spatial (0.1°, 0.25°) and temporal (1 h, 3 h, daily) scales. Precipitation products are analyzed for hydrometeorologically distinct subregions. Results show that IMERG has a superior detection and quantitative rainfall intensity estimation ability than TMPA, particularly in the high Andes. Despite slightly weaker agreement of mean rainfall fields, IMERG shows better characterization of gauge observations when separating rainfall detection and rainfall rate estimation. At corresponding space-time scales, IMERG shows better estimation of gauge rainfall probability distributions than TMPA. However, IMERG shows no improvement in both rainfall detection and rainfall rate estimation along the dry Peruvian coastline, where major random and systematic errors persist. Further research is required to identify which rainfall intensities are missed or falsely detected and how errors can be attributed to specific satellite sensor retrievals. The satellite-gauge difference was associated with the point-area difference in spatial support between gauges and satellite precipitation products, particularly in areas with low and irregular gauge network coverage. Future satellite-gauge evaluations need to identify such locations and investigate more closely interpixel point-area differences before attributing uncertainties to satellite products.},

A general framework is suggested. Data from a number of saturated land sites and open water sites in the absence of advection suggest a widely applicable formula for the relationship between sensible and latent heat fluxes. For drying land surfaces, we assume that the evaporation rate is given by the same formula for evaporation multiplied by a factor. This factor is found to remain at unity while an amount of water, varying from one site to another, is evaporated. Following this a linear decrease sets in, reducing the evaporation rate to zero after a further 5 cm of evaporation, the same at several sites examined.},

In essence, precipitation is supplied by moisture that either comes directly from the ocean, or is subsequently recycled from the continents themselves. Both the processes that control evaporation and the main mechanisms of moisture transport clearly differ between the ocean and the continent, thus within the context of a changing climate, it may be expected that the relationship between precipitation of oceanic and terrestrial origin varies globally and regionally, as will the influence of these two basic components of total precipitation on global and regional precipitation trends, especially in tropical regions. We describe an approach based on a Lagrangian technique for estimating the precipitation in a target region given the proportions of moisture transported from the two sources (ocean and continent) to reveal that the percentage of precipitation of oceanic origin has increased globally in the current climate (1980–2016). The greatest observed rate of increase is in the tropical regions; furthermore, the trends of precipitation in these regions are controlled by trends in precipitation for which the source of moisture is the ocean.},

It is found TWS simulations are more accurate when river storage is taken into account except for dry basins. Rivers play different roles in various climatic regions as indicated by two new indices quantifying the significance of each TWS component and their interactions. River storage, which effectively includes downslope movement of shallow groundwater, explains up to 73% of TWS variations in Amazon. It also acts as "buffer" which smoothes TWS seasonal variations particularly in snowdominated basins. Neglecting river storage may lead to mismatch in the amplitude and phase of TWS seasonal variations compared to the GRACE observations. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is a set of algorithms dedicated to the estimation of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture from satellite data. Ever since its development in 2011, the model has been regularly revised, aiming at the optimal incorporation of new satellite-observed geophysical variables, and improving the representation of physical processes. In this study, the next version of this model (v3) is presented. Key changes relative to the previous version include (1) a revised formulation of the evaporative stress, (2) an optimized drainage algorithm, and (3) a new soil moisture data assimilation system. GLEAM v3 is used to produce three new data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture, including a 36-year data set spanning 1980-2015, referred to as v3a (based on satellite-observed soil moisture, vegetation optical depth and snow-water equivalent, reanalysis air temperature and radiation, and a multi-source precipitation product), and two satellite-based data sets. The latter share most of their forcing, except for the vegetation optical depth and soil moisture, which are based on observations from different passive and active C- and L-band microwave sensors (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative, ESA CCI) for the v3b data set (spanning 2003-2015) and observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite in the v3c data set (spanning 2011-2015). Here, these three data sets are described in detail, compared against analogous data sets generated using the previous version of GLEAM (v2), and validated against measurements from 91 eddy-covariance towers and 2325 soil moisture sensors across a broad range of ecosystems. Results indicate that the quality of the v3 soil moisture is consistently better than the one from v2: Average correlations against in situ surface soil moisture measurements increase from 0.61 to 0.64 in the case of the v3a data set and the representation of soil moisture in the second layer improves as well, with correlations increasing from 0.47 to 0.53. Similar improvements are observed for the v3b and c data sets. Despite regional differences, the quality of the evaporation fluxes remains overall similar to the one obtained using the previous version of GLEAM, with average correlations against eddy-covariance measurements ranging between 0.78 and 0.81 for the different data sets. These global data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture are now openly available at www.GLEAM.eu and may be used for large-scale hydrological applications, climate studies, or research on land-atmosphere feedbacks.},

abstract = {The technological evolution of optical sensors over the last few decades has provided remote sensing analysts with rich spatial, spectral, and temporal information. In particular, the increase in spectral resolution of hyperspectral images (HSIs) and infrared sounders opens the doors to new application domains and poses new methodological challenges in data analysis. HSIs allow the characterization of objects of interest (e.g., land-cover classes) with unprecedented accuracy, and keeps inventories up to date. Improvements in spectral resolution have called for advances in signal processing and exploitation algorithms. This article focuses on the challenging problem of hyperspectral image classification, which has recently gained in popularity and attracted the interest of other scientific disciplines such as machine learning, image processing, and computer vision. In the remote sensing community, the term classification is used to denote the process that assigns single pixels to a set of classes, while the term segmentation is used for methods aggregating pixels into objects and then assigned to a class. {\textcopyright} 1991-2012 IEEE.},

To provide a variety of clustering solutions, the data sets were analyzed by four hierarchical clustering methods. External criterion measures indicated excellent recovery of the true cluster structure by the methods at the correct hierarchy level. Thus, the clustering present in the data was quite strong. The simulation results for the stopping rules revealed a wide range in their ability to determine the correct number of clusters in the data. Several procedures worked fairly well, whereas others performed rather poorly. Thus, the latter group of rules would appear to have little validity, particularly for data sets containing distinct clusters. Applied researchers are urged to select one or more of the better criteria. However, users are cautioned that the performance of some of the criteria may be data dependent.},

However, as the received link signal may also decrease during dry periods, a method to separate wet and dry periods is required. Methods utilizing ground-based radar rainfall intensities or nearby link data cannot always be used. Geostationary satellites can provide a good alternative. A combination of two Meteosat Second Generation satellite precipitation products, Precipitating Clouds and Cloud Physical Properties, is employed to decide whether a 15-min time interval for a given link is rainy or not. A 12-d dataset of link-based rainfall maps for the Netherlands is validated against gauge-adjusted radar rainfall maps. Results clearly improve upon the case when no wet–dry classification is applied and thus the method shows potential for application to large areas of the world where the other methods cannot be applied.},

abstract = {A new technique is presented in which half-hourly global precipitation estimates derived from passive mi-crowave satellite scans are propagated by motion vectors derived from geostationary satellite infrared data. The Climate Prediction Center morphing method (CMORPH) uses motion vectors derived from half-hourly interval geostationary satellite IR imagery to propagate the relatively high quality precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data. In addition, the shape and intensity of the precipitation features are modified (morphed) during the time between microwave sensor scans by performing a time-weighted linear interpolation. This process yields spatially and temporally complete microwave-derived precipitation analyses, independent of the infrared temperature field. CMORPH showed substantial improvements over both simple averaging of the microwave estimates and over techniques that blend microwave and infrared information but that derive estimates of precipitation from infrared data when passive microwave information is unavailable. In particular, CMORPH outperforms these blended techniques in terms of daily spatial correlation with a validating rain gauge analysis over Australia by an average of 0.14, 0.27, 0.26, 0.22, and 0.20 for April, May, June–August, September, and October 2003, respectively. CMORPH also yields higher equitable threat scores over Australia for the same periods by an average of 0.11, 0.14, 0.13, 0.14, and 0.13. Over the United States for June–August, September, and October 2003, spatial correlation was higher for CMORPH relative to the average of the same techniques by an average of 0.10, 0.13, and 0.13, respectively, and equitable threat scores were higher by an average of 0.06, 0.09, and 0.10, respectively.},

abstract = {Land surface properties, such as vegetation cover and soil moisture, influence the partitioning of radiative energy between latent and sensible heat fluxes in daytime hours. During dry periods, soil-water deficit can limit evapotranspiration, leading to warmer and drier conditions in the lower atmosphere. Soil moisture can influence the development of convective storms through such modifications of low-level atmospheric temperature and humidity, which in turn feeds back on soil moisture. Yet there is considerable uncertainty in how soil moisture affects convective storms across the world, owing to a lack of observational evidence and uncertainty in large-scale models. Here we present a global-scale observational analysis of the coupling between soil moisture and precipitation. We show that across all six continents studied, afternoon rain falls preferentially over soils that are relatively dry compared to the surrounding area. The signal emerges most clearly in the observations over semi-arid regions, where surface fluxes are sensitive to soil moisture, and convective events are frequent. Mechanistically, our results are consistent with enhanced afternoon moist convection driven by increased sensible heat flux over drier soils, and/or mesoscale variability in soil moisture. We find no evidence in our analysis of a positive feedback--that is, a preference for rain over wetter soils--at the spatial scale (50-100kilometres) studied. In contrast, we find that a positive feedback of soil moisture on simulated precipitation does dominate in six state-of-the-art global weather and climate models--a difference that may contribute to excessive simulated droughts in large-scale models.},

Several methods for the retrieval of snowfall intensity from satellite have been proposed in recent times using passive and active sensors.

This paper describes steps taken to improve the algorithm in several ways. The number of iterations to solve for stability has been shortened from 20 to 3, and adjustments have been made to the basic profile stability functions. The scalar transfer coefficients have been redefined in terms of the mixing ratio, which is the fundamentally conserved quantity, rather than the measured water vapor mass concentration. Both the velocity and scalar roughness lengths have been changed. For the velocity roughness, the original fixed value of the Charnock parameter has been replaced by one that increases with wind speeds of between 10 and 18 m s−1.

abstract = {Cloud-type classification based on multispectral satellite imagery data has been widely researched and demonstrated to be useful for distinguishing a variety of classes using a wide range of methods. The research described here is a comparison of the classifier output from two very different algorithms applied to Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) data over the course of one year. The first algorithm employs spectral channel thresholding and additional physically based tests. The second algorithm was developed through a supervised learning method with characteristic features of expertly labeled image samples used as training data for a 1-nearest-neighbor classification. The latter's ability to identify classes is also based in physics, but those relationships are embedded implicitly within the algorithm. A pixel-to-pixel comparison analysis was done for hourly daytime scenes within a region in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Considerable agreement was found in this analysis, with many of the mismatches or disagreements providing insight to the strengths and limitations of each classifier. Depending upon user needs, a rule-based or other postprocessing system that combines the output from the two algorithms could provide the most reliable cloud-type classification.},

abstract = {Climate change and its effects on the hydrologic regime of the Amazon basin can impact biogeochemical processes, transportation, flood vulnerability, fisheries and hydropower generation. We examined projections of climate change on discharge and inundation extent in the Amazon basin using the regional hydrological model MGB-IPH with 1-dimensional river hydraulic and water storage simulation in floodplains. Future projections (2070–2099) were obtained from five GCMs from IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report CMIP5. Climate projections have uncertainty and results from different climate models did not agree in total Amazon flooded area or discharge anomalies along the main stem river. Overall, model runs agree better with wetter (drier) conditions over western (eastern) Amazon. Results indicate that increased mean and maximum river discharge for large rivers draining the Andes in the northwest contributes to increased mean and maximum discharge and inundation extent over Peruvian floodplains and Solim{\~{o}}es River (annual mean-max: +9 % - +18.3 %) in western Amazonia. Decreased river discharges (mostly dry season) are projected for eastern basins, and decreased inundation extent at low water (annual min) in the central (−15.9 %) and lower Amazon (−4.4 %).},

abstract = {Terrestrial evaporation (E) is a key climatic variable that is controlled by a plethora of environmental factors. The constraints that modulate the evaporation from plant leaves (or transpiration, Et) are particularly complex, yet are often assumed to interact linearly in global models due to our limited knowledge based on local studies. Here, we train deep learning algorithms using eddy covariance and sap flow data together with satellite observations, aiming to model transpiration stress (St), i.e., the reduction of Et from its theoretical maximum. Then, we embed the new St formulation within a process-based model of E to yield a global hybrid E model. In this hybrid model, the St formulation is bidirectionally coupled to the host model at daily timescales. Comparisons against in situ data and satellite-based proxies demonstrate an enhanced ability to estimate St and E globally. The proposed framework may be extended to improve the estimation of E in Earth System Models and enhance our understanding of this crucial climatic variable. Global evaporation is a key climatic process that remains highly uncertain. Here, the authors shed light on this process with a novel hybrid model that integrates a deep learning representation of ecosystem stress within a physics-based framework.},

abstract = {With the upcoming SWOT satellite mission, which should provide spatially dense river surface elevation, width and slope observations globally, comes the opportunity to assimilate such data into hydrodynamic models, from the reach scale to the hydrographic network scale.Based on the HiVDI (Hierarchical Variational Discharge Inversion) modeling strategy (Larnier et al. (2020)), this study tackles the forward and inverse modeling capabilities of distributed channel parameters and multiple inflows (in the 1D Saint-Venant model) from multisatellite observations of river surface. It is shown on synthetic cases that the estimation of both inflows and distributed channel parameters (bathymetry-friction) is achievable with a minimum spatial observability between inflows as long as their hydraulic signature is sampled. Next, a real case is studied: 871km of the Negro river (Amazon basin) including complex multichannel reaches, 21 tributaries and backwater controls from major confluences. An effective modeling approach is proposed using (i) WS elevations from ENVISAT data and dense in situ GPS flow lines (Moreira (2016)), (ii) average river top widths from optical imagery (Pekel et al. (2016)), (iii) upstream and lateral flows from the MGB large-scale hydrological model (Paiva et al. (2013)). The calibrated effective hydraulic model closely fits satellite altimetry observations and presents real like spatial variabilities; flood wave propagation and water surface observation frequential features are analyzed with identifiability maps followingBrisset et al. (2018). Synthetic SWOT observations are generated from the simulated flowlines and allow to infer model parameters (436 effective bathymetry points, 17 friction patches and 22 upstream and lateral ydrographs) given hydraulically coherent prior parameter values. Inferences of channel parameters carried out on this fine hydraulic model applied at a large scale give satisfying results using noisy SWOT-like data at reach scale. Inferences of spatially distributed temporal parameters (lateral inflows) give satisfying results as well, with even relatively small scale hydrograph variations being inferred accurately on this long reach. This study brings insights in: (i) the hydraulic visibility of multiple inflows hydrographs signature at large scale with SWOT; (ii) the simultaneous identifiability of spatially distributed channel parameters and inflows by assimilation of satellite altimetry data; (iii) the need for prior information; (iv) the need to further tailor and scale network hydrodynamic models and assimilation methods to improve the fusion of multisource information and potential information feedback to hydrological modules in integrated chains.},

abstract = {With the increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery it is important to improve the efficiency and accuracy of satellite image indexing, retrieval and classification. Furthermore, there is a need for utilizing all available satellite imagery in identifying general land cover types and monitoring their changes through time irrespective of their spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions. Therefore, in this study, we developed deep learning models able to efficiently and accurately classify cloud, shadow and land cover scenes in different high-resolution (<10 m) satellite imagery. Specifically, we trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to perform multi-label classification of multi-modal, high-resolution satellite imagery at the scene level. Multi-label classification at the scene level (a.k.a. image indexing), as opposed to the pixel level, allows for faster performance, higher accuracy (although at the cost of detail) and higher generalizability. We investigated the generalization ability (i.e. cross-dataset and geographic independence) of individual and ensemble CNN models trained on multi-modal satellite imagery (i.e. PlanetScope and Sentinel-2). The models trained on PlanetScope imagery collected over the Amazon performed well when applied to PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery collected over the Wet Tropics of Australia with an F2 score of 0.72 and 0.69, respectively. Similarly, PlanetScope-based CNN models trained on imagery collected over the Wet Tropics of Australia performed well when applied to Sentinel-2 imagery with an F2 score of 0.76, and the reverse scenario resulted in the same F2 score of 0.76. This suggests that our CNN models have high cross-dataset generalization ability and are suitable for classifying cloud, shadow and land cover classes in satellite imagery with resolutions from 3 m (PlanetScope) to 10 m (Sentinel-2). The performance of our CNN models was also comparable to the state-of-the-art methods (i.e. Sen2Cor and MACCS) developed specifically for classifying cloud and shadow classes in Sentinel-2 imagery. Finally, we show the potential of our CNN models to mask cloud and shadow contaminated areas from PlanetScope- and Sentinel-2-derived NDVI time-series.},

However, the large volume brings a lot of inconvenience, such as storage and transmission. Hyperspectral band selection is an important technique to cope with this issue by selecting a few spectral bands to replace the original image. This article proposes a novel band selection algorithm that first estimates the redundancy through analysing relationships among spectral bands. After that, spectral bands are ranked according to their relative importance. Subsequently, in order to remove redundant spectral bands and preserve the original information, a maximal linearly independent subset is constructed as the optimal band combination. Contributions of this article are listed as follows: (1) A new strategy for band selection is proposed to preserve the original information mostly; (2) A non-negative low-rank representation algorithm is developed to discover intrinsic relationships among spectral bands; (...},

We coupled this model with a background solution from a large-scale hydrological-hydrodynamic model to study the fate of waters in the Amazon River basin (6 million km2) considering the following: (i) the surface water travel times, (ii) the role of large floodable areas (17% of the basin), and (iii) the relations between water composition and lithological sources. Through numerical experiments, we investigated the spatial distribution of in-stream surface water travel time for the Amazon River Basin (relative to the outlet) and the role of floodplains in seasonal water storage. We estimate that surface water travel time is likely to be less than 90 days (median of 45 days), although about 20% of the flowing water passes through large floodplains. Our modeling exercises indicate that whole-basin monthly water net balance between river and floodplain can reach up to magnitudes of 105 m3/s; the water exchanged with floodplains during the annual floods can represent a large portion (up to 40%) of the basin discharge during low waters season. Finally, we took advantage of the tracking approach to study the hydrograph composition based on parent river lithology quantifying the role of major tributaries. Parallel to the development of global hydrology databases, new modeling approaches are also required to push advances in the discussion of renewal and travel times of surface waters in large river basins.},

abstract = {The elevation of the ocean surface has been measured for over two decades from spaceborne altimeters. However, existing altimeter measurements are not adequate to characterize the dynamic variations of most inland water bodies, nor of ocean eddies at scales of less than about 100 km, notwithstanding that such eddies play a key role in ocean circulation and climate change. For terrestrial hydrology, in situ and spaceborne measurements of water surface elevation form the basis for estimates of water storage change in lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands, and of river discharge. However, storage in most inland water bodies, e.g., millions of Arctic lakes, is not readily measured using existing technologies. A solution to the needs of both surface water hydrology and physical oceanography communities is the measurement of water elevations along rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands and over the ocean surface using swath altimetry. The proposed surface water and ocean topography (SWOT) mission will make such measurements. The core technology for SWOT is the Ka-band radar interferometer (KaRIN), which would achieve spatial resolution on the order of tens of meters and centimetric vertical precision when averaged over targets of interest. Average revisit times will depend upon latitude, with two to four revisits at low to mid latitudes and up to ten revisits at high latitudes per ∼20-day orbit repeat period. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations predict that a complete deforestation of the Amazon basin would lead to a significant climate change; however, it is more difficult to determine the amount of deforestation that would lead to a detectable climate change. This paper examines whether cloudiness has already changed locally in the Brazilian arc of deforestation, one of the most deforested regions of the Amazon basin, where over 15% of the primary forest has been converted to pasture and agriculture. Three pairs of deforested/forested areas have been selected at a scale compatible with that of climate model grids to compare changes in land cover with changes in cloudiness observed in satellite data over a 10-year period from 1984 to 1993. Analysis of cloud cover trends suggests that a regional climate change may already be underway in the most deforested part of the arc of deforestation. Although changes in cloud cover over deforested areas are not significant for interannual variations, they are for the seasonal and diurnal distributions. During the dry season, observations show more low-level clouds in early afternoon and less convection at night and in early morning over deforested areas. During the wet season, convective cloudiness is enhanced in the early night over deforested areas. Generally speaking, the results suggest that deforestation may lead to increased seasonality; however, some of the differences observed between deforested and forested areas may be related to their different geographical locations. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {An observational analysis of Mediterranean Sea water cycle variability based on recently available datasets provides new insights on the long-term changes that affected the region since the 1960s. Results indicate an overall increase in evaporation during 1958-2006, with a decrease up until the mid-1970s and an increase thereafter. Precipitation variability is characterized by substantial interdecadal variations and a negative long-term trend. Evaporation increase, primarily driven by SST variability, together with precipitation decrease resulted in a substantial increase in the loss of freshwater from the Mediterranean Sea toward the overlying atmosphere. An increase in the freshwater deficit is consistent with observed Mediterranean Sea salinity tendencies and has broad implications for the Mediterranean water cycle and connected systems. These observational results are in qualitative agreement with simulated Mediterranean Sea water cycle behavior from a large ensemble of models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3). However, simulated anomalies are about one order of magnitude smaller than those observed. This inconsistency and the large uncertainties associated with the observational rates of change highlight the need for more research to better characterize and understand Mediterranean water cycle variations in recent decades, and to better simulate the crucial underlying processes in global models.},

abstract = {The measurement of global precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, is critical to a wide range of users and applications. Rain gauges are indispensable in the measurement of precipitation, remaining the de facto standard for precipitation information across Earth's surface for hydrometeorological purposes. However, their distribution across the globe is limited: over land their distribution and density is variable, while over oceans very few gauges exist and where measurements are made, they may not adequately reflect the rainfall amounts of the broader area. Critically, the number of gauges available, or appropriate for a particular study, varies greatly across the Earth owing to temporal sampling resolutions, periods of operation, data latency, and data access. Numbers of gauges range from a few thousand available in near–real time to about 100,000 for all “official” gauges, and to possibly hundreds of thousands if all possible gauges are included. Gauges routinely used in the generation of global precipitation products cover an equivalent area of between about 250 and 3,000 m2. For comparison, the center circle of a soccer pitch or tennis court is about 260 m2. Although each gauge should represent more than just the gauge orifice, autocorrelation distances of precipitation vary greatly with regime and the integration period. Assuming each Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC)–available gauge is independent and represents a surrounding area of 5-km radius, this represents only about 1% of Earth's surface. The situation is further confounded for snowfall, which has a greater measurement uncertainty.},

The accuracy of the rainfall product is improved by adaptively adjusting the network parameters using the instantaneous rain-rate estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) microwave imager (TMI product 2A12), and the random errors are further reduced by accumulation to a resolution of 1° × 1° daily. The authors' current GOES-IR - TRMM TMI based product, named PERSIANN-GT, was evaluated over the region 30°S-30°N, 90°E-30°W, which includes the tropical Pacific Ocean and parts of Asia, Australia, and the Americas. The resulting rain-rate estimates agree well with the National Climatic Data Center radar-gauge composite data over Florida and Texas (correlation coefficient p > 0.7). The product also compares well (p ̃ 0.77-0.90) with the monthly World Meteorological Organization gauge measurements for 5° × 5° grid locations having high gauge densities. The PERSIANN-GT product was evaluated further by comparing it with current TRMM products (3A11, 3B31, 3B42, 3B43) over the entire study region. The estimates compare well with the TRMM 3B43 1° × 1° monthly product, but the PERSIANN-GT products indicate higher rainfall over the western Pacific Ocean when compared to the adjusted geosynchronous precipitation index-based TRMM 3B42 product.},

abstract = {Intercatchment groundwater flows (IGFs), defined as groundwater flows across topographic divides, can occur as regional groundwater flows that bypass headwater streams and only drain into the channel further downstream or directly to the sea. However, groundwater flows can also be diverted to adjacent river basins due to geological features (e.g., faults, dipping beds and highly permeable conduits). Even though intercatchment groundwater flows can be a significant part of the water balance, they are often not considered in hydrological studies. Yet, assuming this process to be negligible may introduce misrepresentation of the natural system in hydrological models, for example in regions with complex geological features. The presence of limestone formations in France and Belgium potentially further exacerbates the importance of intercatchment groundwater flows, and thus brings into question the validity of neglecting intercatchment groundwater flows in the Meuse basin. To isolate and quantify the potential relevance of net intercatchment groundwater flows in this study, we propose a three-step approach that relies on the comparison and analysis of (1) observed water balance data within the Budyko framework, (2) results from a suite of different conceptual hydrological models and (3) remote-sensing-based estimates of actual evaporation. The data of 58 catchments in the Meuse basin provide evidence of the likely presence of significant net intercatchment groundwater flows occurring mainly in small headwater catchments underlain by fractured aquifers. The data suggest that the relative importance of net intercatchment groundwater flows is reduced at the scale of the Meuse basin, as regional groundwater flows are mostly expected to be self-contained in large basins. The analysis further suggests that net intercatchment groundwater flow processes vary over the year and that at the scale of the headwaters, net intercatchment groundwater flows can make up a relatively large proportion of the water balance (on average 10 % of mean annual precipitation) and should be accounted for to prevent overestimating actual evaporation rates.},

There is a saturation effect of liquid water path (LWP) on CFL. The highest sensitivity of CFL to LWP corresponds to clouds with low LWP, and sensitivity decreases as LWP increases.

abstract = {Tropical vegetation is a major source of global land surface evapotranspiration, and can thus play a major role in global hydrological cycles and global atmospheric circulation. Accurate prediction of tropical evapotranspiration is critical to our understanding of these processes under changing climate. We examined the controls on evapotranspiration in tropical vegetation at 21 pan-tropical eddy covariance sites, conducted a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of 13 evapotranspiration models at these sites, and assessed the ability to scale up model estimates of evapotranspiration for the test region of Amazonia. Net radiation was the strongest determinant of evapotranspiration (mean evaporative fraction was 0.72) and explained 87% of the variance in monthly evapotranspiration across the sites. Vapor pressure deficit was the strongest residual predictor (14%), followed by normalized difference vegetation index (9%), precipitation (6%) and wind speed (4%). The radiation-based evapotranspiration models performed best overall for three reasons: (1) the vegetation was largely decoupled from atmospheric turbulent transfer (calculated from $\Omega$ decoupling factor), especially at the wetter sites; (2) the resistance-based models were hindered by difficulty in consistently characterizing canopy (and stomatal) resistance in the highly diverse vegetation; (3) the temperature-based models inadequately captured the variability in tropical evapotranspiration. We evaluated the potential to predict regional evapotranspiration for one test region: Amazonia. We estimated an Amazonia-wide evapotranspiration of 1370mmyr-1, but this value is dependent on assumptions about energy balance closure for the tropical eddy covariance sites; a lower value (1096mmyr-1) is considered in discussion on the use of flux data to validate and interpolate models. {\textcopyright}2009 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright}2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a description, sensitivity analyses, sample results, validation, and the recent progress done on the development of a new satellite rainfall estimation technique in the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The technique, called the auto-estimator, runs in real time for applications to flash flood forecasting, numerical modeling, operational hydrology. The auto-estimator uses the Geoestationary Operational Environmental Satellite-8 and -9 in the infrared (IR) 10.7-$\mu$m band to compute real-time precipitation amounts based on a power-law regression algorithm. This regression is derived from a statistical analysis between surface radar-derived instantaneous rainfall estimates and satellite-derived IR cloudtop temperatures collocated in time and space. The rainfall rate estimates are adjusted for different moisture regimes using the most recent fields of precipitable water and relative humidity generated by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Eta Model. In addition, a mask is computed to restrict rain to regions satisfying two criteria: (a) the growth rate of the cloud as a function of the temperature change of the cloud tops in two consecutive IR images must be positive, and (b) the spatial gradients of the cloud-top temperature field must show distinct and isolated cold cores in the cloud-top surface. Both the growth rate and the gradient corrections are useful for locating heavy precipitation cores. The auto-estimator has been used experimentally for almost 3 yr to provide real-time instantaneous rainfall rate estimates, average hourly estimates, and 3-, 6-, and 24-h accumulations over the conterminous 48 United States and nearby ocean areas. The NOAA/NESDIS Satellite Analyses Branch (SAB) has examined the accuracy of the rainfall estimates daily for a variety of storm systems. They have determined that the algorithm produces useful 1-6-h estimates for flash flood monitoring but exaggerates the area of precipitation causing overestimation of 24-h rainfall total associated with slow-moving, cold-topped mesoscale convective systems. The SAB analyses have also shown a tendency for underestimation of rainfall rates in warm-top stratiform cloud systems. Until further improvements, the use of this technique for stratiform events should be considered with caution. The authors validate the hourly rainfall rates of the auto-estimator using gauge-adjusted radar precipitation products (with radar bias removed) in three distinct cases. Results show that the auto-estimator has modest skill at 1-h time resolution for a spatial resolution of 12 km. Results improve with larger grid sizes (48 by 48 km or larger).},

abstract = {The increasing availability of earth observations necessitates mathematical methods to optimally combine such data with hydrologic models. Several algorithms exist for such purposes, under the umbrella of data assimilation (DA). However, DA methods are often applied in a suboptimal fashion for complex real-world problems, due largely to several practical implementation issues. One such issue is error characterization, which is known to be critical for a successful assimilation. Mischaracterized errors lead to suboptimal forecasts, and in the worst case, to degraded estimates even compared to the no assimilation case. Model uncertainty characterization has received little attention relative to other aspects of DA science. Traditional methods rely on subjective, ad hoc tuning factors or parametric distribution assumptions that may not always be applicable. We propose a novel data-driven approach (named SDMU) to model uncertainty characterization for DA studies where (1) the system states are partially observed and (2) minimal prior knowledge of the model error processes is available, except that the errors display state dependence. It includes an approach for estimating the uncertainty in hidden model states, with the end goal of improving predictions of observed variables. The SDMU is therefore suited to DA studies where the observed variables are of primary interest. Its efficacy is demonstrated through a synthetic case study with low-dimensional chaotic dynamics and a real hydrologic experiment for one-day-ahead streamflow forecasting. In both experiments, the proposed method leads to substantial improvements in the hidden states and observed system outputs over a standard method involving perturbation with Gaussian noise.},

abstract = {Tropical forests have an important regulating influence on local and regional climate, through modulating the exchange of moisture and energy between the land and the atmosphere. Deforestation disrupts this exchange, though the climatic consequences of progressive, patch-scale deforestation of formerly intact forested landscapes have not previously been assessed. Remote sensing datasets of land surface and atmospheric variables were used to compare the climate responses of Amazon evergreen broadleaf forests that lost their intact status between 2000 and 2013. Clear gradients in environmental change with increasing disturbance were observed. Leaf area index (LAI) showed progressively stronger reductions as forest loss increased, with evapotranspiration (ET) showing a comparative decline. These changes in LAI and ET were related to changes in temperature (T), with increased warming as deforestation increased. Severe deforestation of intact Amazon forest, defined as areas where canopy cover was reduced below 70 %, was shown to have increased daytime land surface T by 0.44 °C over the study period. Differences between intact and disturbed forests were most pronounced during the dry season, with severely deforested areas warming as much as 1.5 °C. Maintenance of canopy cover was identified as an important factor in minimising the impacts of disturbance. Overall, the results highlight the climate benefits provided by intact tropical forests, providing further evidence that protecting intact forests is of utmost importance.},

abstract = {Different satellite rainfall products are used in different applications over different parts of the world. These products are particularly important over many parts of Africa, where they are used to augment the very sparse rain-gauge network. However, the quality of the different satellite products varies from one product to another and from one climatic region to another. The climate over eastern Africa varies from wet coastal and mountainous regions to dry arid regions. Significant variations could be observed within short distances. The different climates will pose different challenges to satellite rainfall retrieval over this region. This study explores the effect of mountainous and arid climates on four different satellite rainfall-estimation (RFE) algorithms. The mountainous climate is located over the Ethiopian highlands, while the arid region covers parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. One infrared-only product, African rainfall climatology (ARC), one passive-microwave-only product (the Climate Prediction Center morphing technique, CMORPH) and two products (the RFE algorithm and the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM-3B42)), which combine both infrared and passive-microwave estimates, are used for this investigation. All the products exhibit moderate underestimation of rainfall over the highlands of Ethiopia, while the overestimation over the dry region is found to be very high. The underestimation over the mountainous region is ascribed to the warm orographic rain process, while the overestimation over the dry region may be because of sub-cloud evaporation. Local calibration of satellite algorithms and merging of satellite estimates with all locally available rain-gauge observations are some of the approaches that could be employed to alleviate these problems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Efficient and responsible management of water resources relies on accurate streamflow records. However, many watersheds are ungaged, limiting the ability to assess and understand local hydrology. Several tools have been developed to alleviate this data scarcity, but few provide continuous daily streamflow records at individual streamgages within an entire region. Building on the history of hydrologic mapping, ordinary kriging was extended to predict daily streamflow time series on a regional basis. Pooling parameters to estimate a single, time-invariant characterization of spatial covariance structure is 5 shown to produce accurate reproduction of streamflow. This approach is contrasted with a time-varying series of variograms, representing the temporal evolution and behavior of the spatial covariance structure. Furthermore, the ordinary kriging approach is shown to produce more accurate time series than more-common, single-index hydrologic transfers. A comparison between topological kriging and ordinary kriging is less definitive, showing the ordinary kriging approach to be significantly inferior in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiencies while maintaining significantly superior performance measured by root mean 10 squared errors. Given the similarity of performance and the computational efficiency of ordinary kriging, it is concluded that ordinary kriging is useful for first-order approximation of daily streamflow time series in ungaged watersheds.},

abstract = {Across the cratonic landscape of Brazil the Solimoes-Amazon River transports to its delta plain 1240 Mt of suspended sediment derived from Andean erosion and reworks another 3200 Mt of floodplain sediments. Distribution of these sediments has resulted in a variable along-stream pattern of geomorphology. The upstream reaches are characterized by sediment erosion in the main channel and deposition in floodplain channels that are an order of magnitude smaller in discharge than the main channel. Sediment deposition in and migration of the floodplain channels erases oxbow lakes of the main channel and yields an intricate scroll-bar topography that forms the boundaries of hundreds of long, narrow lakes. In contrast, downstream reaches are characterized by channels restricted by stabilizing, long-term, levee building and floodplain construction dominated by overbank deposition. Overbank deposition buries the scroll-bar topography, resulting in a flat floodplain covered by a patchwork of large, more equant, shallow lakes. On the basis of estimated rates of recycling of floodplain sediments, the modern floodplain of the Brazilian Amazon could have been recycled in <5000 yr, and is recycled more rapidly in the upstream than the downstream reaches. The cratonic interior is interrupted by structural arches that bound intracratonic basins. Four of these arches cross the valley of the main river system at intervals of several hundred kilometres and impart a tectonic imprint on the channel-floodplain geomorphology at this spatial scale. Structural arches appear to exert a primary influence by promoting entrenchment of the river as it passes through zones of deformation, thus restricting channel movement. For example, as the river crosses the Purus arch, the valley narrows to <20 km compared to an average of nearly equal 45 km, the water-surface gradient decreases, sediment is deposited, and yet the rate of channel migration is negligible. Hence, the effect of the arches is to create a landscape where, on the spatial scale of hundreds of kilometres, the river is confined and entrenched in its valley, is straight, and is relatively immobile. Local valley tilting apparently unrelated to the arch structures also imprints the geomorphology. In particular, a tilted valley in the upstream reaches appears to have caused avulsions which have left behind the only large-scale, oxbow-type features on the Brazilian Amazon River floodplain.},

abstract = {Patterns of surface sediment concentration distribution in rivers are significant for understanding fluvial morphodynamics and environmental characteristics of the rivers and their floodplains. In the case of the Amazon Basin, complexity in sediment pattern distribution is affected by the anabranching channel pattern of the Amazon River, inputs from tributaries (some of which are among the largest rivers on Earth) and the existence of huge and complex floodplains. In this paper, patterns of surface sediment distribution are modeled based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over the Amazon River by estimating surface sediment concentrations. Specifically, we aim to 1) detect the regional and seasonal variability of surface sediment in the main channel, 2) observe the influence of tributaries into the main system, 3) identify channel-floodplain interactions, and 4) investigate the internal variability of surface sediment along the main channel system. Field surface sediment concentration data from three gauging stations representing the upstream, midstream, and downstream sections of the Amazon River between 2000 and 2010 were used to calibrate 1328 MODIS daily surface reflectance images. Robust empirical models were derived between field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data from each station (0.79<R2<0.92, slopes significant at 99% confidence level) from 752 selected data after quality control. We applied empirical models to 2112 8-day composite surface reflectance images to generate surface sediment distribution maps since 2000. Overall, this study successfully demonstrated the capability of our MODIS-based model to capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface sediments in the Amazon River Basin, the largest river system on Earth. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We present global, vertical profile estimates of the HDO/H2O ratio from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura satellite. We emphasize in this paper the estimation approach and error characterization, which are critical to determining the very small absolute concentration of HDO relative to H2O and its uncertainty. These estimates were made from TES nadir-viewing (downlooking) thermal infrared spectral radiances observed on 20 September 2004. Profiles of HDO and H2O are simultaneously estimated from the observed radiances and a profile of the ratio is then calculated. This simultaneous, or "joint," estimate is regularized with an a priori covariance matrix that includes expected correlations between HDO and H2O. This approach minimizes errors in the profile of the HDO/H2O ratio that are due to overlapping HDO and H2O spectroscopic lines. Under clear-sky conditions in the tropics, TES estimates of the HDO/H2O ratio are sensitive to the distribution of the actual ratio between the surface and about 300 hPa with peak sensitivity at 700 hPa. The sensitivity decreases with latitude through its dependence on temperature and water amount. We estimate a precision of approximately 1% to 2% for the ratio of the HDO/H2O tropospheric densities; however, there is possibly a bias of approximately 5% in the ratio due to the HDO spectroscopic line strengths. These global observations clearly show increased isotopic depletion of water vapor at higher latitudes as well as increased depletion in the upper troposphere versus the lower troposphere.

abstract = {This study is the first global effort to quantify seasonality and extent of inundation with a suite of satellite observations, including passive and active microwave along with visible and infrared measurements. A clustering technique which merges the satellite observations is used to detect inundation. Monthly flooded areas are then calculated by estimating pixel fractional coverage of flooding using the passive microwave signal and a linear mixture model with end-members calibrated with radar observations to account for vegetation cover. The global results, comprising natural wetlands, irrigated rice, and lakes/rivers, indicate a minimum inundated area for the July 1992-June 1993 period of 2.16{\texttimes}106km{\texttwosuperior}, about 38% of the maximum 5.75{\texttimes}106km{\texttwosuperior}, to be compared to maximum areas of 5.83{\texttimes}106km{\texttwosuperior} and 5.70{\texttimes}106km{\texttwosuperior} from independent data sets. Comprehensive evaluation requires substantial additions to the sparse observational record now available.},

abstract = {The aim of this article is to test the sensitivity of the West African hydrological cycle to infiltration processes and to river reinfiltration pathways. This is done through sensitivity experiments to both inputs and paramterization settings of the ORCHIDEE Land-Surface Model. The parameterizations to take into account the effects of flat areas, ponds and floodplains on surface infiltration, and the effect of roots and deep-soil compactness on infiltration are first described. The sensitivity analysis to parameterization settings shows that the surface infiltration processes have a stronger impact in the soudano-sahelian region and more generally in semi-arid African regions, whereas the rootzone and deep-soil infiltration also play a role in the guinean and intermediate regions between arid and humid ones. In the equatorial and semi-humid regions, infiltration processes generally play a minor role. The infiltration parameterizations may explain part of the difference between simulated and observed river discharge in semi-arid and intermediate basins. The sensitivity analysis to the Land-Surface Model inputs shows that different sources of uncertainty might also explain part of the error. Indeed, the precipitation forcing in the whole West African region, the long-term storage in the soudano-sahelian region, the soil types in the guinean region and the vegetation types in the equatorial region are significant sources of errors. Therefore, observations and analyses of small scale infiltration processes as well as continuous measurements of river discharges in West Africa are essential to ensure the reliability of future calibration for the infiltration parameterizations.},

abstract = {The elevation of the ocean surface has been measured for over two decades from spaceborne altimeters. However, existing altimeter measurements are not adequate to characterize the dynamic variations of most inland water bodies, nor of ocean eddies at scales of less than about 100 km, notwithstanding that such eddies play a key role in ocean circulation and climate change. For terrestrial hydrology, in situ and spaceborne measurements of water surface elevation form the basis for estimates of water storage change in lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands, and of river discharge. However, storage in most inland water bodies, e.g., millions of Arctic lakes, is not readily measured using existing technologies. A solution to the needs of both surface water hydrology and physical oceanography communities is the measurement of water elevations along rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands and over the ocean surface using swath altimetry. The proposed surface water and ocean topography (SWOT) mission will make such measurements. The core technology for SWOT is the Ka-band radar interferometer (KaRIN), which would achieve spatial resolution on the order of tens of meters and centimetric vertical precision when averaged over targets of interest. Average revisit times will depend upon latitude, with two to four revisits at low to mid latitudes and up to ten revisits at high latitudes per ∼20-day orbit repeat period. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Accurate and timely surface precipitation measurements are crucial for water resources management, agriculture, weather prediction, climate research, as well as ground validation of satellite-based precipitation estimates. However, the majority of the land surface of the earth lacks such data, and in many parts of the world the density of surface precipitation gauging networks is even rapidly declining. This development can potentially be counteracted by using received signal level data from the enormous number of microwave links used worldwide in commercial cellular communication networks. Along such links, radio signals propagate from a transmitting antenna at one base station to a receiving antenna at another base station. Rain-induced attenuation and, subsequently, path-averaged rainfall intensity can be retrieved from the signal's attenuation between transmitter and receiver. Here, we show how one such a network can be used to retrieve the space-time dynamics of rainfall for an entire country (The Netherlands, ∼35,500 km2), based on an unprecedented number of links (∼2,400) and a rainfall retrieval algorithm that can be applied in real time. This demonstrates the potential of such networks for real-time rainfall monitoring, in particular in those parts of the world where networks of dedicated ground-based rainfall sensors are often virtually absent.},

Nevertheless, climate model predictions vary from rapid drying to modest wetting. Here we report that the catchment of the world's largest river is experiencing a substantial wetting trend since approximately 1990. This intensification of the hydrological cycle is concentrated overwhelmingly in the wet season driving progressively greater differences in Amazon peak and minimum flows. The onset of the trend coincides with the onset of an upward trend in tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). This positive longer-term correlation contrasts with the short-term, negative response of basin- wide precipitation to positive anomalies in tropical North Atlantic SST, which are driven by temporary shifts in the intertropical convergence zone position. We propose that the Amazon precipitation changes since 1990 are instead related to increasing atmospheric water vapor import from the warming tropical Atlantic},

abstract = {During the last decades, satellite observations have increasingly been used to study the global water cycle over land. Although their value is now appreciated by the hydrological community, they are still limited by their uncertainties and their inability to close the water budget. In a previous study, we optimally integrated several datasets for each component (precipitation, evapotranspiration, storage change and discharge) to close this budget at a basin scale. Furthermore, an independent and simple calibration of each satellite dataset was designed to reduce the budget residual. In this paper, we extend the calibration procedure to the global scale. Pixels are first classified into surface types characterized by their NDVI and net precipitation values. We show that the global calibration transforms the original datasets towards a consensus that is hydrologically more coherent, with a budget residual reduced by 26%. The calibrated datasets are compared to ground-based observations, showing an improvement for more than 65% of the sites tested. This opens new perspectives to generate long-term datasets at global scale based purely on all available satellites observations, which describe all the terrestrial water components useful for climate purposes. Beyond the simple calibration presented here, inconsistencies among the various satellite datasets can be used as a proxy for satellite observation uncertainties. The quality of our calibration procedure is constrained by the availability of discharge measurements, and could therefore be improved in the future, as discharge measurement networks become more extensive.},

abstract = {The climatological structure in the upper-tropospheric summertime circulation over South America is diagnosed using a GCM (with and without South American topography), a linear model, and observational data. Emphasis is placed on understanding the origin of observed features such as the Bolivian high and the accompanying "Nordeste low" to the east. Results from the linear model indicate that these two features are generated in response to precipitation over the Amazon basin, central Andes, and South Atlantic convergence zone, with African precipitation also playing a crucial role in the formation of the Nordeste low. The direct mechanical and sensible heating effects of the Andes are minimal, acting only to induce a weak lee trough in midlatitudes and a shallow monsoonal circulation over the central Andes. In the GCM, the effects of the Andes include a strengthening of the Bolivian high and northward shift of the Nordeste low, primarily through changes in the precipitation field. The position of the Bolivian high is primarily determined by Amazonian precipitation and is little affected by the removal of the Andes. Strong subsidence to the west of the high is found to be important for the maintenance of the high's warm core, while large-scale convective overshooting to the east is responsible for a layer of cold air above the high.},

Our data highlight three trends: (1) there is differing seasonality of total net primary productivity (NPP) with the highlands and dry lowlands peaking in the dry season and the humid lowland sites peaking in the wet season, (2) seasonal reductions in wood NPP are not driven by reductions in total NPP but by carbon during the dry season being preferentially allocated toward either roots or canopy NPP, and (3) there is a temporal decoupling between total photosynthesis and total carbon usage (plant carbon expenditure). This decoupling indicates the presence of nonstructural carbohydrates which may allow growth and carbon to be allocated when it is most ecologically beneficial rather than when it is most environmentally available.},

This paper focuses on the compilation of the daily streamflow time series based on 12 free-Toaccess streamflow databases (seven national databases and five international collections). It also describes the development of three metadata products (freely available at https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.887477): (1) a GSIM catalogue collating basic metadata associated with each time series, (2) catchment boundaries for the contributing area of each gauge, and (3) catchment metadata extracted from 12 gridded global data products representing essential properties such as land cover type, soil type, and climate and topographic characteristics. The quality of the delineated catchment boundary is also made available and should be consulted in GSIM application. The second paper in the series then explores production and analysis of streamflow indices. Having collated an unprecedented number of stations and associated metadata, GSIM can be used to advance large-scale hydrological research and improve understanding of the global water cycle.},

abstract = {Data obtained from NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites were used to investigate the relationships between topography, large-scale circulation, and the climatology of precipitation and cloudiness in the Andes - specifically over Peru and the Altiplano Plateau - at diurnal, seasonal, and interannual time scales. The spatial variability of cloudiness was assessed through empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of GOES brightness temperatures. Results indicate that landform is the principal agent of the space-time variability of moist atmospheric processes in the Andes, with the first mode explaining up to 70% of all observed variability. These results substantiate the differences between "continental" (Andes and Himalayas) and "maritime" (Western Cordillera) orographic precipitation regimes, reflecting the degree to which upwind landmasses modulate moisture transport toward and across mountain barriers. GOES brightness temperatures show that afternoon convective activity during the rainy season is more intense on wet hydrometeorological years such as 2001, whereas the space-time structure of nighttime cloudiness at the foothills and outlets of deep interior valleys does not change during the monsoon and from one year to another independently of large-scale conditions. This suggests that daytime cloud formation and precipitation is strongly dependent on large-scale moisture transport. Interactions between mesoscale and ridge-valley circulations, which are locked to the topography, determine the space-time organization of clouds and precipitation at nighttime. This leads to strong clustering of precipitation features associated with enhanced convection at high elevations along the ridges and near the headwaters of the major river systems in the TRMM data. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

Our study focused on the floodplain of Lago Grande de Curua{\'{i}} ({\'{O}}bidos, Brazil), a 4000 km2 segment of floodplain and local upland catchment representative of the lower Amazon. Based on in situ and satellite data acquired from 1997 to 2003, we calculated the exchanges of water between the floodplain and the river and determined the temporal dynamics of flooded area water derived from river flooding, rainfall, runoff, and exchange with groundwater annually for six years. The Amazon River dominated the inputs of water to the flooded area year-round, accounting about 77% of the annual total inputs; rainfall and runoff accounted for about 9% and 10%, respectively, while seepage from the groundwater system accounted for 4%. The hydrologic residence time of the lake was about three months, and the floodplain made a net contribution of water to the river. The exported volume (net balance between water input and losses) varied between 4.2 and 7.3 km3 depending on the year and represented about 0.75 times the maximal storage reached each year. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {How useful are satellite-based rainfall estimates (SRFE) as forcing data for hydrological applications? Which SRFE should be favoured for hydrological modelling? What could researchers do to increase the performance of SRFE-driven hydrological simulations? To address these three research questions, four SRFE (CMORPH, RFE 2.0, TRMM-3B42 and PERSIANN) and one re-analysis product (ERA-Interim) are evaluated within a hydrological application for the time period 2003-2008, over two river basins (Volta and Baro-Akobo) which hold distinct physiographic, climatologic and hydrologic conditions. The focus was on the assessment of: (a) the individual and combined effect of SRFE-specific calibration and bias correction on the hydrological performance, (b) the level of complexity required regarding bias correction and interpolation to achieve a good hydrological performance, and (c) the hydrological performance of SRFE during high- and low-flow conditions. Results show that (1) the hydrological performance is always higher if the model is calibrated to the respective SRFE rather than to interpolated ground observations; (2) for SRFE that are afflicted with bias, a bias-correction step prior to SRFE-specific calibration is essential, while for SRFE with good intrinsic data quality applying only a SRFE-specific model calibration is sufficient; (3) the more sophisticated bias-correction method used in this work (histogram equalization) results generally in a superior hydrological performance, while a more sophisticated spatial interpolation method (Kriging with External Drift) seems to be of added value only over mountainous regions; (4) the bias correction is not over-proportionally important over mountainous catchments, as it solely depends on where the SRFE show high biases (e.g. for PERSIANN and CMORPH over lowland areas); and (5) the hydrological performance during high-flow conditions is superior thus promoting the use of SRFE for applications focusing on the high-end flow spectrum. These results complement a preliminary "ground truthing" phase and provide insight on the usefulness of SRFE for hydrological modelling and under which conditions they can be used with a given level of reliability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

SEBS consists of: a set of tools for the determination of the land surface physical parameters, such as albedo, emissivity, temperature, vegetation coverage etc., from spectral reflectance and radiance measurements; a model for the determination of the roughness length for heat transfer; and a new formulation for the determination of the evaporative fraction on the basis of energy balance at limiting cases. Four experimental data sets are used to assess the reliabilities of SEBS. Based on these case studies, SEBS has proven to be capable to estimate turbulent heat fluxes and evaporative fraction at various scales with acceptable accuracy. The uncertainties in the estimated heat fluxes are comparable to in-situ measurement uncertainties.},

abstract = {The growing concern about environment has increased the number of land surface processes studies. Computer simulation models of land surface processes have been developed for a range of scales and with different levels of physical complexity. Because the interactions between soil, vegetation and atmosphere vary both spatially and temporally, regional evaporation in heterogeneous natural landscapes is difficult to predict by means of computer simulation models. Remote sensing measurements of land surface radiative properties offer however a means to indirectly measure land surface state conditions at a range of scales. A straightforward estimation of evaporation from radiative properties of the land surface is hampered by the fact that only a very few parameters of the classical flux-profile relationships can be estimated directly from remote sensing measurements. Moreover, the accuracy of surface temperature measurements necessary to solve flux-profile relationships is still poor. Inclusion of ground measurements is a possible solution, but the absence of such data on large scales and for heterogeneous land surfaces where these parameters are not measured, forms an immediate obstacle for the implementation of remote sensing algorithms. A Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) has been developed in a way that the need for collateral measurements is partly eliminated, a very accurate surface temperature map is no longer required (although it should be as good as possible) and a land use classification to relate surface temperature to evaporation is not needed. Each pixel is characterized by a surface hemisherical reflectance, surface temperature and a vegetation index. The methodology composes of multiple flux-profile relationships for small sub-areas. Although the concept has a physical basis, the parameters are estimated by empirical relationships, for instance a relationship between near-surface vertical air temperature difference and surface temperature forms an essential component in the estimation of the sensible heat flux density. The absolute surface energy balance terms are estimated on an instantaneous time basis. Temporal integration of instantaneous surface flux densities is feasible using the evaporative fraction (latent heat flux density/net available energy): The evaporative fraction remains fairly constant during daytime hours for both homogeneous and heterogeneous areas. A physical explanation for this is given. A bulk surface resistance of a heterogeneous landscape has been related analytically to canopy and bare soil evaporation resistances. Measurements in central Spain have shown that the evaporative fraction and bulk surface resistance are suitable indicators to describe areal patterns of near-surface soil water content. Although the bulk surface resistance has a distinct diurnal variation, it is much less affected by changes in net available energy and therefore preferred to describe the energy partitioning for longer time series (weeks, months). SEBAL has been validated with data available from regional evaporation projects in Egypt and Spain. The error of high resolution evaporative fraction estimations decreases from 20% to 10% at a scale of 1 km to 5 km respectively. The error of low resolution evaporative fraction images at a scale of 100 km is approximately 1 to 5 %. Hence, the error averages out if a larger set of pixels is considered. It is concluded that the uncertainty of evaporation in regional water balances and model studies can be substantially reduced by estimating evaporation with remote sensing measurements using the proposed SEBAL technique.},

abstract = {Freshwater discharge from the continents is a key component of Earth{\textquoteright}s water cycle that sustains human life and ecosystem health. Surprisingly, owing to a number of socioeconomic and political obstacles, a comprehensive global river discharge observing system does not yet exist. Here we use 13 years (1994{\textendash}2006) of satellite precipitation, evaporation, and sea level data in an ocean mass balance to estimate freshwater discharge into the global ocean. Results indicate that global freshwater discharge averaged 36,055 km{\textthreesuperior}/y for the study period while exhibiting significant interannual variability driven primarily by El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation cycles. The method described here can ultimately be used to estimate long-term global discharge trends as the records of sea level rise and ocean temperature lengthen. For the relatively short 13-year period studied here, global discharge increased by 540 km{\textthreesuperior}/y{\texttwosuperior}, which was largely attributed to an increase of global-ocean evaporation (768 km{\textthreesuperior}/y{\texttwosuperior}). Sustained growth of these flux rates into long-term trends would provide evidence for increasing intensity of the hydrologic cycle.},

abstract = {Flood modeling at global scales represents a revolution in hydraulic science and has the potential to transform decision-making and risk management in a wide variety of fields. Such modeling draws on a rich heritage of algorithm and data set development in hydraulic modeling over the last 20 years, but conceptually the challenges of global flood modeling are the same as those faced at local and reach scales. This chapter therefore examines recent progress in the field of global flood hazard modeling and, in particular, looks at the development of so-called ‘hyperresolution' models, defined here as those with a spatial resolution of 1 km or less. This chapter begins by examining how over the last 10 years the field of two-dimensional hydraulic modeling has moved rapidly from the study of single river reaches perhaps 10–60 km in length or restricted local areas of a few kilometers squared, to regional, continental, or even global scale models. This rapid advance has been enabled by three parallel developments: the discovery of new computationally efficient algorithms for solving 2D flow fields, advances in computing power and architectures, and the development of bespoke versions of global terrain data sets optimized for global flood modeling. To illustrate what is now possible this chapter uses the example of a recently developed hyperresolution model: SSBNflow. This is a 1/1200 arc second spatial resolution (∼90 m at the equator) global flood inundation model that solves the local inertial (i.e., a true hydrodynamic) form of the shallow water equations. The hydraulic engine is a clone of the well-known LISFLOOD-FP model. We describe the background to this model and its structure and report the results of a number of extensive validation tests. These show the model to perform well, within the best cases the performance, approaching that of a bespoke model built with local (rather than global) data. We describe how the hazard data can be used to produce global flood risk estimates, and, finally, we provide an extensive discussion of model limitations. Although this is still a young field, the progress, to date, has been rapid. Such models are already making a huge contribution to such fields as disaster risk reduction, disaster forecasting, risk finance, and humanitarian relief efforts, and the prospects for further improvements in model skill are very good.},

The non-seasonal anomalies were observed in sea surface height (from altimetry), as well as ocean mass (from gravimetry), indicating they were mostly of barotropic nature. These relatively rapid basin-wide fluctuations occurred over time scales of 1-5 months. Here we use observations and re-analysis data to attribute the non-seasonal sea level and ocean mass fluctuations in the Mediterranean Sea to concurrent wind stress anomalies over the adjacent subtropical Northeast Atlantic Ocean, just west of the Strait of Gibraltar, and extending into the strait itself.

Climate change is expected to additionally affect water supply and demand. Here, analyses of climate change and direct human impacts on the terrestrial water cycle are presented and compared using a multimodel approach. Seven global hydrological models have been forced with multiple climate projections, and with and without taking into account impacts of human interventions such as dams and water withdrawals on the hydrological cycle. Model results are analyzed for different levels of global warming, allowing for analyses in line with temperature targets for climate change mitigation. The results indicate that direct human impacts on the water cycle in some regions, e.g., parts of Asia and in the western United States, are of the same order of magnitude, or even exceed impacts to be expected for moderate levels of global warming (+2 K). Despite some spread in model projections, irrigation water consumption is generally projected to increase with higher global mean temperatures. Irrigation water scarcity is particularly large in parts of southern and eastern Asia, and is expected to become even larger in the future.},

abstract = {Multi-source precipitation merging has been used for improving global precipitation estimation accuracy. However, current merging techniques heavily rely on gauge-based precipitation and/or streamflow observations, which may contain substantial uncertainties over data-poor regions. This study provides a triple collocation (TC) based framework for merging multi-source precipitation products without the access of high-quality ground observations. In this framework, the error variances of the precipitation products are statistically estimated using TC, which are further employed in parameterizing a least-square-based precipitation merging framework. As validated against high-quality gauge observations collected over Europe, we demonstrate that TC can accurately estimate the relative errors of different precipitation products, which leads to robust multi-source precipitation merging. Results also demonstrate that the TC merged product significantly outperforms the parent products, which is noteworthy - given the strong skills of the reanalyzed (ERA-Interim) precipitation product over Europe. Since TC analysis does not rely on high-quality gauge observations, the proposed TC-based merging framework can be applied globally, and is expected to significantly contribute precipitation data merging over data-poor regions, e.g., Africa and South America.},

abstract = {Estimations of hydrological descriptors are required for studying links between river flow and ecological processes at different scales, from local scale at which biological and/or water quality data are usually available, to larger scale for sustainable development purposes. The study of regional hydrology has seen significant advances in recent years due to new developments in statistics, environmental database access, and calculating capabilities. Nevertheless, theoretical difficulties for mapping and for estimating river regime characteristics at ungauged locations remain because of the nature of the variable under study: river flows are related to a specific area, i.e. the drainage basin, and are hierarchically organized in space through the river network with upstream-downstream dependencies. This presentation aims at describing a method for producing choropleth maps of average runoff and computing mean discharge along the main river network. The approach applied to mean annual runoff is based on geostatistical interpolation procedures coupled with empirical relationships and is illustrated by an application to assess water resource in France. The performance of the developed approach is tested against two other geostatistical methods (ordinary kriging and residual kriging). This study concludes that the classical approaches for interpolation can be improved by explicitly introducing hydrological properties of the mapped variable. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Rainfall-runoff modelling is one of the key challenges in the field of hydrology. Various approaches exist, ranging from physically based over conceptual to fully data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a special type of recurrent neural network. The advantage of the LSTM is its ability to learn long-term dependencies between the provided input and output of the network, which are essential for modelling storage effects in e.g. catchments with snow influence. We use 241 catchments of the freely available CAMELS data set to test our approach and also compare the results to the well-known Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA) coupled with the Snow-17 snow routine. We also show the potential of the LSTM as a regional hydrological model in which one model predicts the discharge for a variety of catchments. In our last experiment, we show the possibility to transfer process understanding, learned at regional scale, to individual catchments and thereby increasing model performance when compared to a LSTM trained only on the data of single catchments. Using this approach, we were able to achieve better model performance as the SAC-SMA+Snow-17, which underlines the potential of the LSTM for hydrological modelling applications.},

abstract = {The transport of freshwater from continents to oceans through rivers has traditionally been estimated by routing runoff from land surface models within river models to obtain discharge. This paradigm imposes that errors are transferred from runoff to discharge, yet the analytical propagation of uncertainty from runoff to discharge has never been derived. Here we apply statistics to the continuity equation within a river network to derive two equations that propagate the mean and variance/covariance of runoff errors independently. We validate these equations in a case study of the rivers in the western United States and, for the first time, invert observed discharge errors for spatially distributed runoff errors. Our results suggest that the largest discharge error source is the joint variability of runoff errors across space, not the mean or amplitude of individual errors. Our findings significantly advance the science of error quantification in model-based estimates of river discharge.},

abstract = {In this paper, a hydrologic/hydrodynamic modeling of the Amazon River basin is presented using the MGB-IPH model with a validation using remotely sensed observations. Moreover, the sources of model errors by means of the validation and sensitivity tests are investigated, and the physical functioning of the Amazon basin is also explored. The MGB-IPH is a physically based model resolving all land hydrological processes and here using a full 1-D river hydrodynamic module with a simple floodplain storage model. River-floodplain geometry parameters were extracted from the SRTM digital elevation model, and the model was forced using satellite-derived rainfall from TRMM3B42. Model results agree with observed in situ daily river discharges and water levels and with three complementary satellite-based products: (1) water levels derived from ENVISAT altimetry data; (2) a global data set of monthly inundation extent; and (3) monthly terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experimental mission. However, the model is sensitive to precipitation forcing and river-floodplain parameters. Most of the errors occur in westerly regions, possibly due to the poor quality of TRMM 3B42 rainfall data set in these mountainous and/or poorly monitored areas. In addition, uncertainty in river-floodplain geometry causes errors in simulated water levels and inundation extent, suggesting the need for improvement of parameter estimation methods. Finally, analyses of Amazon hydrological processes demonstrate that surface waters govern most of the Amazon TWS changes (56%), followed by soil water (27%) and ground water (8%). Moreover, floodplains play a major role in stream flow routing, although backwater effects are also important to delay and attenuate flood waves. {\textcopyright}2013. American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has become a hot topic in the field of remote sensing. In general, the complex characteristics of hyperspectral data make the accurate classification of such data challenging for traditional machine learning methods. In addition, hyperspectral imaging often deals with an inherently nonlinear relation between the captured spectral information and the corresponding materials. In recent years, deep learning has been recognized as a powerful feature-extraction tool to effectively address nonlinear problems and widely used in a number of image processing tasks. Motivated by those successful applications, deep learning has also been introduced to classify HSIs and demonstrated good performance. This survey paper presents a systematic review of deep learning-based HSI classification literatures and compares several strategies for this topic. Specifically, we first summarize the main challenges of HSI classification which cannot be effectively overcome by traditional machine learning methods, and also introduce the advantages of deep learning to handle these problems. Then, we build a framework which divides the corresponding works into spectral-feature networks, spatial-feature networks, and spectral-spatial-feature networks to systematically review the recent achievements in deep learning-based HSI classification. In addition, considering the fact that available training samples in the remote sensing field are usually very limited and training deep networks require a large number of samples, we include some strategies to improve classification performance, which can provide some guidelines for future studies on this topic. Finally, several representative deep learning-based classification methods are conducted on real HSIs in our experiments.},

abstract = {The prominent Andes cordillera induces significant differences in climates between its eastern and western slopes. These climatic differences are largely reflected by contrasting vegetation and ice coverages but remain poorly documented. This study quantifies the abrupt changes of precipitation and cloud properties at both sides of the Andes south of 20°S by using surface daily precipitation and satellite (CloudSat and MODIS) data during the 2006-2016 period. Results show that the precipitation changes drastically and precipitating clouds can be of very different nature on each side of the Andes. In the tropical Andes (20-25°S), precipitation normally falls from a sole layer of thick stratiform and convective precipitating clouds during the warm semester, but the annual mean accumulation is about 10-100 times larger on the eastern than on the western slopes. A sole layer of low stratus clouds dominates over the Pacific coast, occasionally producing light rains, whereas high, thin, and non-precipitating clouds dominate most of the time over the continent. In the subtropical Andes (25-35°S), annual mean precipitation is similar on both sides, however, it falls from convective and stratiform precipitating clouds in the warm semester on the eastern slopes, and from stratiform precipitating clouds in the cold semester, mostly as frozen particles, on the western slopes. These different features on both slopes denote a climatic transition between the tropics and extratropics. In the extratropical Andes (south of 35°S), stratiform cloud types produces precipitation on both sides during all the year, but the annual mean precipitation and cloud frequency are enhanced on the western slopes and strongly reduced on the eastern slopes of the Andes. Cloud frequencies are higher than in the subtropics and evenly distributed as single- or multi-layers of low, middle and high clouds. Frozen particles become important in precipitating clouds over the mountains and on the lee side. These findings demonstrate the significant influence of the Andes cordillera on the climate all along southwestern South America, and constitute an excellent example of how the simple dependence of climate on latitude can be substantially altered by the topography.},

abstract = {There is strong evidence that the expansion and intensification of irrigation over the twentieth century has affected climate in many regions. However, it remains uncertain if these irrigation effects, including buffered warming trends, will weaken or persist under future climate change conditions. Using a 20-member climate model ensemble simulation, we demonstrate that irrigation will continue to attenuate greenhouse gas-forced warming and soil moisture drying in many regions over the 21st century, including Mexico, the Mediterranean, Southwest Asia, and China. Notably, this occurs without any further expansion or intensification of irrigation beyond current levels, even while greenhouse gas forcing steadily increases. However, the magnitude and significance of these moderating irrigation effects vary across regions and are highly sensitive to the background climate state and the degree to which evapotranspiration is supply (moisture) versus demand (energy) limited. Further, limitations on water and land availability may restrict our ability to maintain modern irrigation rates into the future. Nevertheless, it is likely that irrigation, alongside other components of intensive land management, will continue to strongly modulate regional climate impacts in the future. Irrigation should therefore be considered in conjunction with other key regional anthropogenic forcings (e.g., land cover change and aerosols) when investigating the local manifestation of global climate drivers (e.g., greenhouse gases) in model projections.},

The optimal spectral sampling (OSS) method has been designed specifically for the modeling of radiances measured by sounding radiometers in the infrared and has been extended to the microwave; it is applicable also through the visible and ultraviolet spectrum. OSS is particularly well suited for remote sensing applications and for the assimilation of satellite observations in numerical weather prediction models. The novel OSS approach is an extension of the exponential sum fitting of transmittances technique in that channel-average radiative transfer is obtained from a weighted sum of monochromatic calculations.

@article{Fisher2020a,
abstract = {Poorly monitored river flows in many regions of the world have been hindering our ability to accurately estimate global water budgets as well as the variability of the global water cycle. In situ gauging sites, as well as a number of satellite-based systems, make observations of river discharge throughout the globe; however, these observations are often sparse due to, for example, the sampling frequencies of sensors or a lack of reporting. Recently, efforts have been made to develop methods to integrate these discrete observations to gain a better understanding of the underlying processes. This paper presents an application of a fixed interval Kalman smoother-based model, called inverse streamflow routing (ISR), to generate spatially and temporally continuous river discharge fields from discrete observations. The method propagates the observed information across all reachable parts of the river network (up/downstream from gauging point) and all reachable times (before/after observation time) using a two-sweep procedure that first propagates information backward in time to the furthest upstream locations (inverse routing) and then propagates it forward in time to the furthest downstream locations (forward routing). The ISR methodology advances prediction of streamflow in ungauged basins by accounting for a physical representation of the river system that is not generally handled explicitly in more-commonly applied statistically based models. The key advantages of this approach are that it (1) maintains all the physical consistencies embodied by a diffusive wave routing model (flow confluence relationships on the river network and the resulting mass balance, wave velocity, and diffusivity), (2) updates the lateral influx (runoff) at the pixel level (furthest upstream) to guarantee exhaustive propagation of observed information, and (3) works both with a first guess of initial river discharge conditions from a routing model (assimilation) and without a first guess (pure interpolation of observations). Two sets of experiments are carried out under idealized conditions and under real-world conditions provided by United States Geological Survey (USGS) observations. Results show that the method can effectively reproduce the spatial and temporal dynamics of river discharge in each of the experiments presented. The performance is driven by the density of the gauge network as well as the quality of the data being assimilated. We find that when assimilating the actual USGS observations, the performance decreases relative to our idealized scenario; however, we are still able to produce an improved discharge product at each validation site. With further testing, as well as global application, ISR may prove to be a useful method for extending our current network of global river discharge observations.},

Although the variability of the Amazon hydrological cycle has been increasing since the late 1990s, its underlying causes have remained elusive. We use water levels in the Amazon River to quantify changes in extreme events and then analyze their cause. Despite continuing research emphasis on droughts, the largest change over recent decades is a marked increase in very severe floods. Increased flooding is linked to a strengthening of the Walker circulation, resulting from strong tropical Atlantic warming and tropical Pacific cooling. Atlantic warming due to combined anthropogenic and natural factors has contributed to enhance the change in atmospheric circulation. Whether this anomalous increase in flooding will last depends on the evolution of the tropical inter-ocean temperature difference.},

abstract = {Biomass burning in the Brazilian Amazon is modulated by climate factors, such as droughts, and by human factors, such as deforestation, and land management activities. The increase in forest fires during drought years has led to the hypothesis that fire activity decoupled from deforestation during the twenty-first century. However, assessment of the hypothesis relied on an incorrect active fire dataset, which led to an underestimation of the decreasing trend in fire activity and to an inflated rank for year 2015 in terms of active fire counts. The recent correction of that database warrants a reassessment of the relationships between deforestation and fire. Contrasting with earlier findings, we show that the exacerbating effect of drought on fire season severity did not increase from 2003 to 2015 and that the record-breaking dry conditions of 2015 had the least impact on fire season of all twenty-first century severe droughts. Overall, our results for the same period used in the study that originated the fire-deforestation decoupling hypothesis (2003–2015) show that decoupling was clearly weaker than initially proposed.

Therefore, the role of deforestation as a driver of fire activity in the region should not be underestimated and must be taken into account when implementing measures to protect the Amazon forest.},

abstract = {The Amazon Basin is Brazil's next frontier for hydropower, but alterations to the water cycle from climate change and deforestation could affect river flows fuelling electricity generation. This research investigated the effects of global and regional changes to the largest network of planned and existing dams within a single basin in the Amazon (the Tapajόs River), which altogether accounts for nearly 50% of the inventoried potential expansion in Brazil. Future hydrological conditions could delay the period of maximum daily generation by 22–29 d, worsening the mismatch between seasonal electricity supply and peak demand. Overall, climate change could decrease dry season hydropower potential by 430–312 GWh per month (−7.4 to −5.4%), while combined effects of deforestation could increase interannual variability from 548 to 713–926 GWh per month (+50% to +69%). Incorporating future change and coordinating dam operations should be a premise in energy planning that could help develop more resilient energy portfolios.},

abstract = {Life on Earth vitally depends on the availability of water. Human pressure on freshwater resources is increasing, as is human exposure to weather-related extremes (droughts, storms, floods) caused by climate change. Understanding these changes is pivotal for developing mitigation and adaptation strategies. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) defines a suite of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), many related to the water cycle, required to systematically monitor the Earth's climate system. Since long-term observations of these ECVs are derived from different observation techniques, platforms, instruments, and retrieval algorithms, they often lack the accuracy, completeness, resolution, to consistently to characterize water cycle variability at multiple spatial and temporal scales.Here, we review the capability of ground-based and remotely sensed observations of water cycle ECVs to consistently observe the hydrological cycle. We evaluate the relevant land, atmosphere, and ocean water storages and the fluxes between them, including anthropogenic water use. Particularly, we assess how well they close on multiple temporal and spatial scales. On this basis, we discuss gaps in observation systems and formulate guidelines for future water cycle observation strategies. We conclude that, while long-term water-cycle monitoring has greatly advanced in the past, many observational gaps still need to be overcome to close the water budget and enable a comprehensive and consistent assessment across scales. Trends in water cycle components can only be observed with great uncertainty, mainly due to insufficient length and homogeneity. An advanced closure of the water cycle requires improved model-data synthesis capabilities, particularly at regional to local scales.},

With a finer grid box of 0.1°, these products should provide more detailed information than their latest widely-adapted (relatively coarser spatial scale, 0.25°) counterpart. Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation version 6 (GSMaP-v6) assessment is done by comparing their rainfall estimations with 247 rainfall gauges from 2014 to 2016 in Bolivia. The comparisons were done on annual, monthly and daily temporal scales over the three main national watersheds (Amazon, La Plata and TDPS), for both wet and dry seasons to assess the seasonal variability and according to different slope classes to assess the topographic influence on SREs. To observe the potential enhancement in rainfall estimates brought by these two recently released products, the widely-used TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product is also considered in the analysis. The performances of all the products increase during the wet season. Slightly less accurate than TMPA, IMERG can almost achieve its main objective, which is to ensure TMPA rainfall measurements, while enhancing the discretization of rainy and non-rainy days. It also provides the most accurate estimates among all products over the Altiplano arid region. GSMaP-v6 is the least accurate product over the region and tends to underestimate rainfall over the Amazon and La Plata regions. Over the Amazon and La Plata region, SRE potentiality is related to topographic features with the highest bias observed over high slope regions. Over the TDPS watershed, the high rainfall spatial variability with marked wet and arid regions is the main factor influencing SREs.},

abstract = {During the past decades large-scale models have been developed to simulate global and continental terrestrial water cycles. It is an open question whether thesemodels are suitable to capture hydrological drought, in terms of runoff, on a global scale. Amultimodel ensemble analysis was carried out to evaluate if 10 such large-scalemodels agree on major drought events during the second half of the twentieth century. Time series of monthly precipitation, monthly total runofffrom 10 global hydrologicalmodels, and their ensemblemedian have been used to identify drought. Temporal development of area in drought for various regions across the globe was investigated. Model spread was largest in regions with low runoffand smallest in regions with high runoff. In vast regions, correlation between runoffdrought derived from the models and meteorological drought was found to be low. This indicated that models add information to the signal derived from precipitation and that runoffdrought cannot directly be determined from precipitation data alone in global drought analyses with a constant aggregation period. However, duration and spatial extent of major drought events differed between models. Some models showed a fast runoffresponse to rainfall, which led to deviations from reported drought events in slowly responding hydrological systems. By using an ensemble of models, this fast runoffresponse was partly overcome and delay in drought propagating from meteorological drought to drought in runoffwas included. Finally, an ensemble of models also allows for consideration of uncertainty associated with individual model structures. ? 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {<p>Abstract. Global cloud climatologies have been built from 13 years of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and 8 years of Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) observations, using an updated Clouds from Infrared Sounders (CIRS) retrieval. The CIRS software can handle any infrared (IR) sounder data. Compared to the original retrieval, it uses improved radiative transfer modelling, accounts for atmospheric spectral transmissivity changes associated with CO2 concentration and incorporates the latest ancillary data (atmospheric profiles, surface temperature and emissivities). The global cloud amount is estimated to be 0.67–0.70, for clouds with IR optical depth larger than about 0.1. The spread of 0.03 is associated with ancillary data. Cloud amount is partitioned into about 40 % high-level clouds, 40 % low-level clouds and 20 % mid-level clouds. The latter two categories are only detected in the absence of upper clouds. The A-Train active instruments, lidar and radar of the CALIPSO and CloudSat missions, provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the retrieved AIRS cloud properties. CIRS cloud height can be approximated either by the mean layer height (for optically thin clouds) or by the mean between cloud top and the height at which the cloud reaches opacity. This is valid for high-level as well as for low-level clouds identified by CIRS. IR sounders are particularly advantageous to retrieve upper-tropospheric cloud properties, with a reliable cirrus identification, day and night. These clouds are most abundant in the tropics, where high opaque clouds make up 7.5 %, thick cirrus 27.5 % and thin cirrus about 21.5 % of all clouds. The 5 % annual mean excess in high-level cloud amount in the Northern compared to the Southern Hemisphere has a pronounced seasonal cycle with a maximum of 25 % in boreal summer, in accordance with the moving of the ITCZ peak latitude, with annual mean of 4° N, to a maximum of 12° N. This suggests that this excess is mainly determined by the position of the ITCZ. Considering interannual variability, tropical cirrus are more frequent relative to all clouds when the global (or tropical) mean surface gets warmer. Changes in relative amount of tropical high opaque and thin cirrus with respect to mean surface temperature show different geographical patterns, suggesting that their response to climate change might differ.</p>},

abstract = {The increasing availability of remote sensing products for all components of the terrestrial water cycle makes it now possible to evaluate the potential of water balance closure purely from remote sensing sources. We take precipitation (P) from the TMPA and CMORPH products, a Penman-Monteith based evapotranspiration (E) estimate derived from NASA Aqua satellite data and terrestrial water storage change (delta S) from the GRACE satellite. Their combined ability to close the water budget is evaluated over the Mississippi River basin for 2003-5 by estimating streamflow (Q) as a residual of the water budget and comparing to streamflow measurements. We find that Q is greatly overestimated due mainly to the high bias in P, especially in the summer. Removal of systematic biases in P reduces the error significantly. However, uncertainties in the individual budget components due to simplifications in process algorithms and input data error are generally larger than the measured streamflow.

abstract = {<p>Over the last 25 years, the Arctic sea ice has seen its extent decline dramatically. Passive microwave observations, with their ability to penetrate clouds and their independency to sunlight, have been used to provide sea ice concentration (SIC) measurements since the 1970s. The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) is a high priority candidate mission within the European Copernicus Expansion program, with a special focus on the observation of the polar regions. It will observe at 6.9 and 10.65 GHz with 15 km spatial resolution, and at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz with 5 km spatial resolution. SIC algorithms are based on empirical methods, using the difference in radiometric signatures between the ocean and sea ice. Up to now, the existing algorithms have been limited in the number of channels they use. In this study, we proposed a new SIC algorithm called Ice Concentration REtrieval from the Analysis of Microwaves (IceCREAM). It can accommodate a large range of channels, and it is based on the optimal estimation. Linear relationships between the satellite measurements and the SIC are derived from the Round Robin Data Package of the sea ice Climate Change Initiative. The 6 and 10 GHz channels are very sensitive to the sea ice presence, whereas the 18 and 36 GHz channels have a better spatial resolution. A data fusion method is proposed to combine these two estimations. Therefore, IceCREAM will provide SIC estimates with the good accuracy of the 6+10GHz combination, and the high spatial resolution of the 18+36GHz combination.</p>},

abstract = {The classification of very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images is essential in many applications. However, high intraclass and low interclass variations in these kinds of images pose serious challenges. Fully convolutional network (FCN) models, which benefit from a powerful feature learning ability, have shown impressive performance and great potential. Nevertheless, only classification results with coarse resolution can be obtained from the original FCN method. Deep feature fusion is often employed to improve the resolution of outputs. Existing strategies for such fusion are not capable of properly utilizing the low-level features and considering the importance of features at different scales. This paper proposes a novel, end-to-end, fully convolutional network to integrate a multiconnection ResNet model and a class-specific attention model into a unified framework to overcome these problems. The former fuses multilevel deep features without introducing any redundant information from low-level features. The latter can learn the contributions from different features of each geo-object at each scale. Extensive experiments on two open datasets indicate that the proposed method can achieve class-specific scale-adaptive classification results and it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The results were submitted to the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) online contest for comparison with more than 50 other methods. The results indicate that the proposed method (ID: SWJ_2) ranks #1 in terms of overall accuracy, even though no additional digital surface model (DSM) data that were offered by ISPRS were used and no postprocessing was applied.},

abstract = {Digital drainage direction maps are a prerequisite for analyzing the flow of water on the land surface of the Earth. For continental or global studies, the most appropriate and most frequently used resolution for such data sets appears to be 30′ (longitude-by-latitude). In this paper we present the new global drainage direction map DDM30, a 30′ raster map of surface drainage directions, which organizes the Earth's land area into drainage basins and provides the river network topology. DDM30 was generated by first upscaling two drainage direction maps (DDMs) at higher resolutions. The resulting map was then extensively corrected in an iterative manner by comparison against vectorized, high resolution river maps and other geographic information. Finally, it was co-referenced to the locations of 935 gauging stations (provided by the Global Runoff Data Centre GRDC), which again involved manual corrections. DDM30 was validated against drainage basin areas from the literature, against the given upstream areas of the GRDC stations and, most importantly, against information from HYDRO1k, a data set based on a hydrologically corrected 1-km digital elevation model which is thought to afford the best information on surface drainage currently available at the global scale. In the course of the validation, the quality of DDM30 was compared to three other 30′ DDMs. The validation results show that DDM30 provides a more accurate representation of drainage directions and river network topology than the other 30′ DDMs. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The performance of hydrological and hydrometeorological water-balance-based methods to estimate monthly runoff is analyzed. Such an analysis also allows for the examination of the closure of water budgets at different spatial (continental and catchment) and temporal (monthly, seasonal, and annual) scales. For this analysis, different combinations of gridded observations [Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), Climate Prediction Center (CPC), Climatic Research Unit (CRU), and University of Delaware (DEL)], atmospheric reanalysismodels [InterimECMWFRe-Analysis (ERA-Interim), Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)], partially model-based datasets [Global Land Surface Evaporation: The Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16), and FLUXNETMulti-Tree Ensemble (FLUXNETMTE)], and GravityRecovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite-derived water storage changes are employed. The derived ensemble of hydrological and hydrometeorological budget-based runoff estimates, together with results from different land surface hydrological models [Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and the land-only version of MERRA (MERRA-Land)] and a simple predictor based on the precipitation-runoff ratio, is compared with observedmonthly in situ runoff for 96 catchments of different sizes and climatic conditions worldwide. Despite significant shortcomings of the budget-based methods over many catchments, the evaluation allows for the demarcation of areas with consistently reasonable runoff estimates. Good agreement was particularly observed when runoff followed a dominant annual cycle like the Amazon. This holds true also for catchments with an area far below the spatial resolution of GRACE, like the Rhine. Over catchmentswith low or nearly constant runoff, the budget-based approaches do not provide realistic runoff estimates because of significant biases in the input datasets. In general, no specific data combination could be identified that consistently performed over all catchments. Thus, the performance over a specific single catchment cannot be extrapolated to other regions. Only in few cases do specific dataset combinations provide reasonable water budget closure; in most cases, significant imbalances remain for all the applied datasets.},

abstract = {This paper documents the spatiotemporal evolution of wet-day and dry-day frequency (WDF and DDF) in the western Amazon, its relationships with oceanic and atmospheric variability and possible impact on vegetation. WDF and DDF changed significantly during the 1980–2009 period (p < 0.05). An increase in WDF is observed after 1995 over the northern part of the western Amazon (Mara{\~{n}}{\'{o}}n basin). The average annual value of WDF changed from 22 days/yr before 1995 to 34 days after that date (+55% after 1995). In contrast, DDF increased significantly over the central and southern part of this region (Ucayali basin) after 1986. Average annual DDF was 16.2 days before 1986 and 23.8 days afterward (+47% after 1986). Interannual variability in WDF appears to be modulated by changes in Pacific SST and the Walker cell during the November–March season. This mechanism enhances convective activity over the northern part of the western Amazon. The increase in DDF is related to warming of the North Tropical Atlantic SST, which produces changes in the Hadley cell and subsidence over the central and the southern western Amazon. More intense seasonal hydrological extremes in the western Amazon therefore appear to be related to changes in WDF and DDF that occurred in 1995 and 1986, respectively. During the 2001–2009 period, an index of vegetation condition (NDVI) appears negatively correlated with DDF (r = −0.95; p < 0.0001). This suggests that vegetation in the western Amazon is mainly water limited, rather than light limited and indicates that the vegetation is highly sensitive to concentration of rainfall.},

abstract = {A process-based methodology is applied to esti-mate land-surface evaporation from multi-satellite informa-tion. GLEAM (Global Land-surface Evaporation: the Am-sterdam Methodology) combines a wide range of remotely-sensed observations to derive daily actual evaporation and its different components. Soil water stress conditions are de-fined from a root-zone profile of soil moisture and used to estimate transpiration based on a Priestley and Taylor equa-tion. The methodology also derives evaporationfrom bare soil and snow sublimation. Tall vegetation rainfall intercep-tion is independently estimated by means of the Gash analyt-ical model. Here, GLEAM is applied daily, at global scale and a quarter degree resolution. Triple collocation is used to calculate the error structure of the evaporation estimates and test the relative merits of two different precipitation in-puts. The spatial distribution of evaporation – and its differ-ent components – is analysed to understand the relative im-portance of each component over different ecosystems. An-nual land evaporation is estimated as 67.9 × 10 3 km 3 , 80% corresponding to transpiration, 11% to interception loss, 7% to bare soil evaporation and 2% snow sublimation. Results show that rainfall interception plays an important role in the partition of precipitation into evaporation and water available for runoff at a continental scale. This study gives insights into the relative importance of precipitation and net radiation in driving evaporation, and how the seasonal influence of these controls varies over different regions. Precipitation is recog-nised as an important factor driving evaporation, not only in areas that have limited soil water availability, but also in ar-eas of high rainfall interception and low available energy.},

abstract = {Because of climate change, much attention is drawn to the Amazon River basin, whose hydrology has already been strongly affected by extreme events during the past 20 years. Hydrological annual extreme variations (i.e. low/high flows) associated with precipitation (and evapotranspiration) changes are investigated over the Amazon River sub-basins using the land surface model ORCHIDEE and a multimodel approach. Climate change scenarios from up to eight AR4 Global Climate Models based on three emission scenarios were used to build future hydrological projections in the region, for two periods of the 21st century. For the middle of the century under the SRESA1B scenario, no change is found in high flow on the main stem of the Amazon River ({\'{O}}bidos station), but a systematic discharge decrease is simulated during the recession period, leading to a 10% low-flow decrease. Contrasting discharge variations are pointed out depending on the location in the basin. In the western upper part of the basin, which undergoes an annual persistent increase in precipitation, high flow shows a 7% relative increase for the middle of the 21st century and the signal is enhanced for the end of the century (12%). By contrast, simulated precipitation decreases during the dry seasons over the southern, eastern and northern parts of the basin lead to significant low-flow decrease at several stations, especially in the Xingu River, where it reaches -50%, associated with a 9% reduction in the runoff coefficient. A 18% high-flow decrease is also found in this river. In the north, the low-flow decrease becomes higher toward the east: a 55% significant decrease in the eastern Branco River is associated with a 13% reduction in the runoff coefficient. The estimation of the streamflow elasticity to precipitation indicates that southern sub-basins (except for the mountainous Beni River), that have low runoff coefficients, will become more responsive to precipitation change (with a 5 to near 35% increase in elasticity) than the western sub-basins, experiencing high runoff coefficient and no change in streamflow elasticity to precipitation. These projections raise important issues for populations living near the rivers whose activity is regulated by the present annual cycle of waters. The question of their adaptability has already arisen. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {<p>Besides their strong contribution to weather forecast improvement through data assimilation, thermal infrared sounders onboard polar-orbiting platforms are now playing a key role for monitoring atmospheric composition changes. The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument developed by the French space agency (CNES) and launched by EUMETSAT onboard the Metop satellite series is providing essential inputs for weather forecasting and pollution/climate monitoring owing to its smart combination of large horizontal swath, good spectral resolution and high radiometric performance. EUMETSAT is currently preparing the next polar-orbiting program (EPS-SG) with the Metop-SG satellite series that should be launched around 2020. In this framework, CNES is studying the concept of a new instrument, the IASI-New Generation (IASI-NG), characterized by an improvement of both spectral and radiometric characteristics as compared to IASI, with three objectives: (i) continuity of the IASI/Metop series; (ii) improvement of vertical resolution; and (iii) improvement of the accuracy and detection threshold for atmospheric and surface components. In this paper, we show that an improvement of spectral resolution and radiometric noise fulfil these objectives by leading to (i) a better vertical coverage in the lower part of the troposphere, thanks to the increase in spectral resolution; and (ii) an increase in the accuracy of the retrieval of several thermodynamic, climate and chemistry variables, thanks to the improved signal-to-noise ratio as well as less interference between the signatures of the absorbing species in the measured radiances. The detection limit of several atmospheric species is also improved. We conclude that IASI-NG has the potential to strongly benefit the numerical weather prediction, chemistry and climate communities now connected through the European GMES/Copernicus initiative.</p>},

To fully exploit the vast amount of spectral information from these instruments, superfast radiative transfer models are needed. We present a novel radiative transfer model based on principal component analysis. Instead of predicting channel radiance or transmittance spectra directly, the principal component-based radiative transfer model (PCRTM) predicts the principal component (PC) scores of these quantities. This prediction ability leads to significant savings in computational time. The parameterization of the PCRTM model is derived from the properties of PC scores and instrument line-shape functions. The PCRTM is accurate and flexible. Because of its high speed and compressed spectral information format, it has great potential for superfast one-dimensional physical retrieval and for numerical weather prediction large volume radiance data assimilation applications. The model has been successfully developed for the NAST-I and AIRS instruments. The PCRTM model performs monochromatic radiative transfer calculations and is able to include multiple scattering calculations to account for clouds and aerosols.},

The analyses show that all products except PERSIANN exhibit overestimation over Aral Sea and its surrounding areas. The bias-correction improves the quality of the original satellite TMPA products and GSMaP significantly but slightly in CMORPH and PERSIANN over Central Asia. 3B42RTV7 overestimates precipitation significantly with large Relative Bias (RB) (128.17%) while GSMaP_Gauge shows consistent high correlation coefficient (CC) (>0.8) but RB fluctuates between −57.95% and 112.63%. The PERSIANN_CDR outperforms other products in winter with the highest CC (0.67). Both the satellite-only and gauge adjusted products have particularly poor performance in detecting rainfall events in terms of lower POD (less than 65%), CSI (less than 45%) and relatively high FAR (more than 35%).},

abstract = {Atmospheric moisture within a region is supplied by both local evaporation and advected from external sources. The contribution of local evaporation in a region to the precipitation in the same region is defined as " precipitation recycling. " Precipitation recycling helps in defining the role of land–atmosphere interac-tions in regional climate. A dynamic precipitation recycling model, which includes the moisture storage term, has been applied to calculate summer variability of the precipitation recycling over Europe based on 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data. Time series for three subregions in Europe (central Europe, the Balkans, and Spain) are obtained to analyze the variability in recycling and to compare the potential in the subregions for interactions between land surface and atmospheric processes. In addition, the recycled precipitation and recycling ratios are linked to several components of the water vapor balance equation [precipitation, evaporation, precipitation minus evaporation (P Ϫ E), and moisture transport]. It is found that precipitation recycling is large in dry summers for central Europe, while the opposite is true for the Balkans. Large precipitation recycling is determined in relation with weak moisture transport and high evaporation rates in central Europe. This occurs for dry summers. For the Balkans, precipitation recycling is large in wet summers when moisture transport is weak, and P Ϫ E and evaporation are large. Here, the recycling process intensifies the hydrological cycle due to a positive feedback via convective precipitation and therefore the amount of recycled precipitation is larger. For Spain, recycling is also larger when moisture transport is weak, but other correlations are not found. For regions such as central Europe in dry summers and the Balkans in wet summers, which are susceptible to land–atmosphere interactions, future climate and/or land use can have an impact on the regional climate conditions due to changes in evaporation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art in understanding and quantification of the Mediterranean heat and mass (i.e. salt and water) budgets. The budgets are decomposed into a basin averaged surface component, lateral boundary components (through the Gibraltar and the Dardanelles Straits), a river input component and a content change component. An assessment of the different methods and observational products that have been used to quantify each of these components is presented. The values for the long term average of each component are also updated based on existing literature and a first estimate of heat fluxes associated with the riverine input has been produced. Special emphasis is put on the characterization of associated uncertainties and proposals for advancing current knowledge are presented for each budget component. With the present knowledge of the different components, the Mediterranean budgets can be closed within the range of uncertainty. However, the uncertainty range remains relatively high for several terms, particularly the basin averaged surface heat fluxes. Consequently, the basin averaged heat budget remains more strongly constrained by the Strait of Gibraltar heat transport than by the surface heat flux. It is worth remarking that if a short (∼few years) averaging period is used, then the heat content change must also be considered to constrain the heat budget. Concerning the water and salt fluxes, the highest uncertainties are found in the direct estimates of the Strait of Gibraltar water and salt transport. Therefore, the indirect estimate of those transports using the budget closure leads to smaller uncertainties than the estimates based on direct observations. Finally, estimates of Mediterranean heat and salt content trends are also reviewed. However, these cannot be improved through the indirect estimates due to the large temporal uncertainties associated to the surface fluxes and the fluxes through Gibraltar. The consequences of these results for estimates of the Mediterranean temperature and salinity trends obtained from numerical modelling are also considered.},

abstract = {A robust and simple algorithm is developed to merge L-band radiometer retrievals and L-band radar observations to obtain high-resolution (9-km) soil-moisture estimates from data of the NASA Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission. The algorithm exploits the established accuracy of coarse-scale radiometer soil-moisture retrievals and blends this with the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity detectable by radar observations to produce a high-resolution optimal soil-moisture estimate at 9 km. The capability of the algorithm is demonstrated by implementing the approach using the airborne Passive and Active L-band System (PALS) instrument data set from Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 (SMEX02) and a four-month synthetic data set in an Observation System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) framework. The results indicate that the algorithm has the potential to obtain better soil-moisture accuracy at a high resolution and show an improvement in root-mean-square error of 0.015-0.02-cm3/cm3 volumetric soil moisture over the minimum performance taken to be retrievals based on radiometer measurements resampled to a finer scale. These results are based on PALS data from SMEX02 and a four-month OSSE data set and need to be further confirmed for different hydroclimatic regions using airborne data sets from prelaunch calibration/validation field campaigns of the SMAP mission.

abstract = {High-resolution raster hydrography maps are a fundamental data source for many geoscience applications. Here we introduce MERIT Hydro, a new global flow direction map at 3-arc sec resolution ($\sim$90 m at the equator) derived from the latest elevation data (MERIT DEM) and water body data sets (G1WBM, Global Surface Water Occurrence, and OpenStreetMap). We developed a new algorithm to extract river networks near automatically by separating actual inland basins from dummy depressions caused by the errors in input elevation data. After a minimum amount of hand editing, the constructed hydrography map shows good agreement with existing quality-controlled river network data sets in terms of flow accumulation area and river basin shape. The location of river streamlines was realistically aligned with existing satellite-based global river channel data. Relative error in the drainage area was <0.05 for 90% of Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) gauges, confirming the accuracy of the delineated global river networks. Discrepancies in flow accumulation area were found mostly in arid river basins containing depressions that are occasionally connected at high water levels and thus resulting in uncertain watershed boundaries. MERIT Hydro improves on existing global hydrography data sets in terms of spatial coverage (between N90 and S60) and representation of small streams, mainly due to increased availability of high-quality baseline geospatial data sets. The new flow direction and flow accumulation maps, along with accompanying supplementary layers on hydrologically adjusted elevation and channel width, will advance geoscience studies related to river hydrology at both global and local scales.},

For this purpose collocated pairs of data were merged within a certain temporal and spatial threshold into single events, according to the satellites' overpass, the observation and the ERA-Interim times. HOAPS detects the frequency of precipitation well, while ERA-Interim strongly overestimates it, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Although precipitation rates are difficult to compare because along-track point measurements are collocated with areal estimates and the number of available data are limited, we find that HOAPS underestimates precipitation rates, while ERA-Interim's Atlantic-wide average precipitation rate is close to measurements. However, when regionally averaged over latitudinal belts, deviations between the observed mean precipitation rates and ERA-Interim exist. The most obvious ERA-Interim feature is an overestimation of precipitation in the area of the intertropical convergence zone and the southern subtropics over the Atlantic Ocean. For a limited number of snow measurements by optical disdrometers, it can be concluded that both HOAPS and ERA-Interim are suitable for detecting the occurrence of solid precipitation.</p>},

Most of these improvements, however, are conceptual in nature and apply equally to other passive microwave sensors. The improvements were motivated by a notable overestimation of precipitation in the intertropical convergence zone. This problem was traced back to the algorithm's poor separation between convective and stratiform precipitation coupled with a poor separation between stratiform and transition regions in the a priori cloud model database. In addition to now using an improved convective–stratiform classification scheme, the new algorithm also makes use of emission and scattering indices instead of individual brightness temperatures. Brightness temperature indices have the advantage of being monotonic functions of rainfall. This, in turn, has allowed the algorithm to better define the uncertainties needed by the sc...},

abstract = {Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data are used to indicate mechanisms responsible for extreme summer convection over South America. The three-dimensional reflectivity field is analyzed to define three types of extreme echo, deep convective cores, wide convective cores, and broad stratiform regions. The location and timing of these echoes are sensitive to midlatitude synoptic disturbances crossing the Andes. At the leading edges of these disturbances the nocturnal South American low-level jet (SALLJ) transports moisture along the eastern edge of the Andes from the tropical to the subtropical part of the continent. Where the SALLJ rises over lower but steep mountains on the east side of the southern central Andes, deep and wide convective cores are triggered in the evening. When the SALLJ withdraws to the north as the disturbance passes, nocturnal triggering occurs in the northeastern foothills of the central Andes. Extreme convection over the Amazon basin takes the form of broad stratiform regions that evolve from systems with wide convective cores moving into the center of the region from both the southwest and northeast. The systems from the northeast form at the northeast coast and are likely squall lines. Along the coast of the Brazilian Highlands, diurnal/topographic forcing leads to daytime maxima of deep convective cores followed a few hours later by wide convective cores. Wide convective cores and broad stratiform regions form in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) with a diurnal cycle related to continental heating. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

Our analysis is based on comprehensive discharge, rainfall and average suspended sediment data sets. Particular attention is paid to the 2010–11 hydrological year, when an unprecedented abrupt transition from the extreme September 2010 drought (8300 m 3 s −1 ) to one of the four highest discharges in April 2011 (49 500 m 3 s −1 ) was recorded at Tamshiyacu (Amazonas River). This unusual transition is also observed in average suspended sediments. Years with a rapid increase in discharge are characterized by negative sea surface temperature anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific during austral summer, corresponding to a La Ni{\~{n}}a-like mode. It originates a geopotential height wave train over the subtropical South Pacific and southeastern South America, with a negative anomaly along the southern Amazon and the southeastern South Atlantic convergence zone region. As a consequence, the monsoon flux is retained over the Amazon and a strong convergence of humidity occurs in the Peruvian Amazon basin, favoring high rainfall and discharge. These features are also reported during the 2010–11 austral summer, when an intense La Ni{\~{n}}a event characterized the equatorial Pacific.},

abstract = {This study quantifies mean annual and monthly fluxes of Earth's water cycle over continents and ocean basins during the first decade of the millennium. To the extent possible, the flux estimates are based on satellite measurements first and data-integrating models second. A careful accounting of uncertainty in the estimates is included. It is applied within a routine that enforces multiple water and energy budget constraints simultaneously in a variational framework, in order to produce objectively-determined, optimized flux estimates. In the majority of cases, the observed annual, surface and atmospheric water budgets over the continents and oceans close with much less than 10% residual. Observed residuals and optimized uncertainty estimates are considerably larger for monthly surface and atmospheric water budget closure, often nearing or exceeding 20% in North America, Eurasia, Australia and neighboring islands, and the Arctic and South Atlantic Oceans. The residuals in South America and Africa tend to be smaller, possibly because cold land processes are negligible. Fluxes were poorly observed over the Arctic Ocean, certain seas, Antarctica, and the Australasian and Indonesian Islands, leading to reliance on atmospheric analysis estimates. Many of the satellite systems that contributed data have been or will soon be lost or replaced. Models that integrate ground-based and remote observations will be critical for ameliorating gaps and discontinuities in the data records caused by these transitions. Continued development of such models is essential for maximizing the value of the observations. Next generation observing systems are the best hope for significantly improving global water budget accounting.},

abstract = {Terrestrial water storage is an important component of the climate system as it determines the partitioning of the water and energy fluxes at the land surface. Since in situ measurements are scarce, there is a strong need for alternative validation data sources. Here we present a new dataset of monthly basin-scale terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) derived with the combined atmospheric-terrestrial water-balance approach, also referred to as basin-scale water-balance (BSWB) approach. It is diagnosed from observation-constrained reanalysis data for the atmospheric fields and observed streamflow. A previous BSWB dataset derived from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis ERA-40 provided reasonable estimates of TWSC for mid-latitude basins. The here presented BSWB dataset is derived from the latest ECMWF reanalysis ERA-Interim, which is available in real time. The potential real-time availability of TWSC derived from ERA-Interim is of great relevance for several agricultural, hydrological, and climate applications. An uncertainty analysis of the derived TWSC highlights the importance of the atmospheric moisture flux convergence fields from the reanalysis for the resulting product uncertainty. We find that the BSWB estimates have a relative uncertainty of about 4-6% in basins larger than 1.5 x 10(6) km(2) compared with the mean seasonal cycle. The ERA-Interim based dataset compares better with in situ soil moisture, snow depth, and groundwater measurements in the Ob basin and Illinois than the previous ERA-40 based dataset. We further compare the BSWB datasets to retrievals from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), scatterometer data from the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites, and land surface model output from the second phase of the Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP). We find a better correlation between ERS and the BSWB data than between GRACE and the BSWB data, which might be related to the relatively coarse resolution of GRACE. GSWP model output and the BSWB datasets compare well in most of the studied river basins. Copyright. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {<p>The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has provided us with unforeseen information on terrestrial water-storage (TWS) variability, contributing to our understanding of global hydrological processes, including hydrological extreme events and anthropogenic impacts on water storage. Attempts to decompose GRACE-based TWS signals into its different water storage layers, i.e., surface water storage (SWS), soil moisture, groundwater and snow, have shown that SWS is a principal component, particularly in the tropics, where major rivers flow over arid regions at high latitudes. Here, we demonstrate that water levels, measured with radar altimeters at a limited number of locations, can be used to reconstruct gridded GRACE-based TWS signals in the Amazon basin, at spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 3, with mean absolute errors (MAE) as low as 2.5 cm and correlations as high as 0.98. We show that, at 3 spatial resolution, spatially-distributed TWS time series can be precisely reconstructed with as few as 41 water-level time series located within the basin. The proposed approach is competitive when compared to existing TWS estimates derived from physically based and computationally expensive methods. Also, a validation experiment indicates that TWS estimates can be extrapolated to periods beyond that of the model regression with low errors. The approach is robust, based on regression models and interpolation techniques, and offers a new possibility to reproduce spatially and temporally distributed TWS that could be used to fill inter-mission gaps and to extend GRACE-based TWS time series beyond its timespan.</p>},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Author(s). The Mediterranean region is one of the climate hotspots where the climate change impacts are both pronounced and documented. The HyMeX (Hydrometeorological Mediterranean eXperiment) aims to improve our understanding of the water cycle from the meteorological to climate scales. However, monitoring the water cycle with Earth observations (EO) is still a challenge: EO products are multiple, and their utility is degraded by large uncertainties and incoherences among the products. Over the Mediterranean region, these difficulties are exacerbated by the coastal/mountainous regions and the small size of the hydrological basins. Therefore, merging/integration techniques have been developed to reduce these issues. We introduce here an improved methodology that closes not only the terrestrial but also the atmospheric and ocean budgets. The new scheme allows us to impose a spatial and temporal multiscale budget closure constraint. A new approach is also proposed to downscale the results from the basin to pixel scales (at the resolution of 0.25°). The provided Mediterranean WC budget is, for the first time, based mostly on observations such as the GRACE water storage or the netflow at the Gibraltar Strait. The integrated dataset is in better agreement with in situ measurements, and we are now able to estimate the Bosporus Strait annual mean netflow.-},

abstract = {We study the potential of millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths for precipitation retrieval from geostationary sensors based on mesoscale cloud modeling and radiative transfer computation. Hydrometeor profiles simulated with the Meso-NH cloud resolving model for five European midlatitude situations are used to compute the brightness temperatures at frequencies from 23.8 to 875 GHz with the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM). Performances of both rain detection and rain rate retrieval are analyzed for different frequency sets, over ocean and land separately, and compared to the user requirements. The performances of a frequency set such as that already planned for geostationary satellites (with channels in the O2 lines at 50, 118, and 424 GHz, and in the H2O lines at 183, 325, 380 GHz) satisfy the requirements for Numerical Weather Prediction and NoWCasting in terms of rain detection as well as for rain rate retrieval above 1 mm/h. Suppressing the 50 GHz O2 channels does not seriously degrade the performances, except for rain rate below 1 mm/h, and, in addition, limits the spatial resolution problem from a geostationary orbit. Adding the thermal infrared observations has a limited impact. The retrieval of other hydrometeor quantities (cloud, ice) is also tested as well as the possibility to retrieve rain and the other hydrometeor profiles. These theoretical results are evaluated at close-to-millimeter wavelengths with coincident AMSU-B and radar observations (BALTEX and CAMRa). The results are degraded with respect to the theory, as expected, but are consistent with the observations.},

@article{Miralles2015,
abstract = {<p>The WACMOS-ET project aims to advance the development of land evaporation estimates at global and regional scales. Its main objective is the derivation, validation and inter-comparison of a group of existing evaporation retrieval algorithms driven by a common forcing data set. Three commonly used process-based evaporation methodologies are evaluated: the Penman–Monteith algorithm behind the official Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evaporation product (PM-MOD), the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), and the Priestley and Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL). The resulting global spatiotemporal variability of evaporation, the closure of regional water budgets and the discrete estimation of land evaporation components or sources (i.e. transpiration, interception loss and direct soil evaporation) are investigated using river discharge data, independent global evaporation data sets and results from previous studies. In a companion article (Part 1), Michel et al. (2015) inspect the performance of these three models at local scales using measurements from eddy-covariance towers, and include the assessment the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model. In agreement with Part 1, our results here indicate that the Priestley and Taylor based products (PT-JPL and GLEAM) perform overall best for most ecosystems and climate regimes. While all three products adequately represent the expected average geographical patterns and seasonality, there is a tendency from PM-MOD to underestimate the flux in the tropics and subtropics. Overall, results from GLEAM and PT-JPL appear more realistic when compared against surface water balances from 837 globally-distributed catchments, and against separate evaporation estimates from ERA-Interim and the Model Tree Ensemble (MTE). Nonetheless, all products manifest large dissimilarities during conditions of water stress and drought, and deficiencies in the way evaporation is partitioned into its different components. This observed inter-product variability, even when common forcing is used, implies caution in applying a single data set for large-scale studies in isolation. A general finding that different models perform better under different conditions highlights the potential for considering biome- or climate-specific composites of models. Yet, the generation of a multi-product ensemble, with weighting based on validation analyses and uncertainty assessments, is proposed as the best way forward in our long-term goal to develop a robust observational benchmark data set of continental evaporation.</p>},

abstract = {This study extends the popular triple collocation method for error assessment from three source estimates to an arbitrary number of source estimates, i.e., to solve the "multiple" collocation problem. Past efforts on multiple collocation fall short of delivering a well-defined, well-interpreted and unique solution thus may result in inconsistent conclusions. Here the error assessment problem is solved through Pythagorean constraints in Hilbert space, which is slightly different from the original inner product solution but allows us to define a unique solution to the multiple collocation. The Pythagorean solution is fully equivalent to the original inner product solution for the triple collocation case. The multiple collocation turns out to be an over-constrained problem and a least squares solution is presented. As the most critical assumption of uncorrelated errors will surely fail in most multiple collocation problems, we propose to divide the source estimates into structural groups based on their production process and treat the structural and non-structural errors separately. Such error separation allows the source estimates to have their structural errors fully correlated within the same structural group, which is much more realistic than the original assumption. A new error assessment procedure is developed which performs the collocation twice, each for one type of errors (structural and non-structural), and then sums up the two types of errors. The new procedure is also fully backward compatible with the original triple collocation technique. Error assessment experiments are carried out for surface soil moisture data from multiple remote sensing models, land surface models, and in situ measurements.},

An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed.},

abstract = {Reliable precipitation information provided by rain gauge networks is invaluable for applications ranging from climatological studies to validation of remote sensing rainfall estimates. Daily precipitation data from 235 tipping bucket gauges in the Legal Brazilian Amazon are quality controlled for the period 1998-2009 by comparing precipitation time series from individual rain gauges with neighboring stations. Within a geostatistical framework, optimal distances for the comparison between stations are identified while considering the density of the network and the spatial structure of the precipitation. The number of rain gauges used as neighboring rain gauges varies between 2 and 57. Each gauge station is compared to nearby gauge stations using fourteen climate and statistical indicators. A proposed variability index allows for the detection of 'suspicious' precipitation data before more detailed analysis of the nature of the issue and the time period of concern in the time series. The internal consistency of the database is examined through the use of variograms and cross validation. The sensitivity of the effectiveness of the quality control procedure to the comparison distance is examined. These results are positive and this demonstrates that the spatial structure of daily rainfall is better sampled. The cross validation confirms that the quality control procedures improved the consistency of the database. Finally, the spatial consistency of the rainfall database is assessed through a classification of the seasonal regimes in the Legal Brazilian Amazon.},

abstract = {The WAter Cycle Multi-mission Observation Strategy - EvapoTranspiration (WACMOS-ET) project aims to advance the development of land evaporation estimates on global and regional scales. Its main objective is the derivation, validation, and intercomparison of a group of existing evaporation retrieval algorithms driven by a common forcing data set. Three commonly used process-based evaporation methodologies are evaluated: the Penman-Monteith algorithm behind the official Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evaporation product (PM-MOD), the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), and the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL). The resulting global spatiotemporal variability of evaporation, the closure of regional water budgets, and the discrete estimation of land evaporation components or sources (i.e. transpiration, interception loss, and direct soil evaporation) are investigated using river discharge data, independent global evaporation data sets and results from previous studies. In a companion article (Part 1), Michel et al. (2016) inspect the performance of these three models at local scales using measurements from eddy-covariance towers and include in the assessment the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model. In agreement with Part 1, our results indicate that the Priestley and Taylor products (PT-JPL and GLEAM) perform best overall for most ecosystems and climate regimes. While all three evaporation products adequately represent the expected average geographical patterns and seasonality, there is a tendency in PM-MOD to underestimate the flux in the tropics and subtropics. Overall, results from GLEAM and PT-JPL appear more realistic when compared to surface water balances from 837 globally distributed catchments and to separate evaporation estimates from ERA-Interim and the model tree ensemble (MTE). Nonetheless, all products show large dissimilarities during conditions of water stress and drought and deficiencies in the way evaporation is partitioned into its different components. This observed inter-product variability, even when common forcing is used, suggests that caution is necessary in applying a single data set for large-scale studies in isolation. A general finding that different models perform better under different conditions highlights the potential for considering biome- or climate-specific composites of models. Nevertheless, the generation of a multi-product ensemble, with weighting based on validation analyses and uncertainty assessments, is proposed as the best way forward in our long-term goal to develop a robust observational benchmark data set of continental evaporation.},

The skill of the NN retrieval is compared to that of the ESA-CCI soil moisture retrieval as well as modeled soil moisture fields from ERA-interim/land. The NN retrieval is able to capture the observed soil moisture temporal variations with a station-average correlation and anomaly correlation of 0.45 and 0.35, respectively. For most ground stations the model obtained a higher temporal correlation skill, with average correlation and anomaly correlation values of 0.53 and 0.46, respectively. For stations in data-sparse regions, the NN retrieval showed a slightly better performance than the model, illustrating the potential of soil moisture retrievals to inform models in data-sparse areas. A time series analysis further showed that the retrieval is well able to capture soil moisture variability outside of active precipitation phases, such as the soil moisture behavior during the dry down phase. Compared to the ESA-CCI retrieval, the NN methodology obtained higher correlations, as a result of its ability to use the complementary information provided by the active and passive microwave sensors. A global evaluation of the retrieval errors through a triple collocation analysis with SMOS and GLDAS soil moisture estimates showed that the errors are high in energy limited regions, where the NN retrieval appears to be lacking input information. In the data-sparse regions of Africa and South America, the triple collocation analysis confirmed the higher skill of the NN retrieval compared to the model.},

It covers, from east to west, the coastal zone, the western slope of the Andes, the Andean Mantaro basin (500–5000 masl), and the Andes-Amazon transition region in the eastern Andes. The study covers the January months from 2004 to 2008. Three experiments were conducted using different topography and land use data sources: (1) a control simulation using the default WRF topography and land use datasets from the United States Geological Survey (USGS); (2) a simulation changing only the topography by using the SRTM topography dataset; and (3) a simulation changing the land use data of (2) by a new dataset adapted from Eva et al. (2004). SRTM topography performed better than the control simulation for representing the actual altitudes of 57 meteorological stations that were used for precipitation and surface air temperature data. As a result, the simulations of experiments (2) and (3) produced lower bias values than that of (1). Topography change (experiment (2)) showed improvements in temperature bias that were directly associated with linear modifications of -5.6 and -6.7 °C∙km−1 in minimum and maximum temperature, respectively. Increasing (decreasing) precipitation with topography or land use change was clearly controlled by changes in the moisture flux patterns and its convergence (divergence) in the Andes-Amazon transition. On the western slope, precipitation increase could be associated with the increase in easterly flow by the smaller altitudes of the Andes mountains in SRTM topography and by increasing evaporation with new land use. Inside the Mantaro Basin, low level moisture flux seems to control the rainfall changes. Overall, relative changes (positive or negative) in precipitation due to topography or land use change could reach values above 25%.},

abstract = {Globally, water is an important resource required for the survival of human beings. Water is a scarce resource in the semi-arid environments, including South Africa. In South Africa, several studies have quantified evapotranspiration (ET) in different ecosystems at a local scale. Accurate spatially explicit information on ET is rare in the country mainly due to lack of appropriate tools. In recent years, a remote sensing ET product from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MOD16) has been developed. However, its accuracy is not known in South African ecosystems. The objective of this study was to validate the MOD16 ET product using data from two eddy covariance flux towers, namely; Skukuza and Malopeni installed in a savanna and woodland ecosystem within the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Eight day cumulative ET data from the flux towers was calculated to coincide with the eight day MOD16 products over a period of 10 years from 2000 to 2010. The Skukuza flux tower results showed inconsistent comparisons with MOD16 ET. The Malopeni site achieved a poorer comparison with MOD16 ET compared to the Skukuza, and due to a shorter measurement period,  data validation was performed for 2009 only. The inconsistent comparison of MOD16 and flux tower-based ET can be attributed to, among other things, the parameterization of the Penman-Monteith model, flux tower measurement errors, and flux tower footprint vs. MODIS pixel. MOD16 is important for global inference of ET, but for use in South Africa's integrated water management, a locally parameterized and improved product should be developed.},

abstract = {AtmosphericCO2 is consumed both by organic matter formation and chemical rock weathering, and subsequently discharged as dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and dis- solved inorganic carbon to the oceans by rivers. In the long term, varying the ratio of the amount of atmospheric CO2 consumed by continental erosion and the amount of CO2 released during carbonate precipitation and organic matter respiration in the oceans can change the CO2 content in the atmosphere. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether riverine organic carbon fluxes during the last glacial maximum (LGM) may have been different from today in order to assess the potential impact on atmospheric CO2. Previous studies mainly focused on the role of the river fluxes of inorganic carbon in this respect, but none of them examined possible variations in the fluxes of organic carbon, although the erosion of organic carbon actually represents the bulk of the atmosphericCO2 consumption by continental erosion. We therefore applied a global carbon erosion model to a LGM scenario in order to determine the riverine fluxes of organic matter during that time. The climatic conditions during the LGM were reconstructed using a computer simulation with a general circulation model. It is found that during the LGM the riverine organic carbon input into the oceans was at least $\sim$10% lower than today. Most of the reduction of the total organic matter fluxes is due to the reduction of the fluxes of dissolved organic carbon. The fluxes of particulate organic carbon remained almost unchanged. The oceanic response to the lower carbon input was estimated on the basis of a present-day steady state budget for organic river carbon in the oceans, and implies that the reduction of the river fluxes were more than counterbalanced by lower burial rates due to the smaller shelf area during the LGM. This suggests that both the lower river carbon input and the relatively greater share of this carbon being subjected to oceanic respiration, acted as a negative feedback to the low atmospheric CO2 content during the LGM},

abstract = {Whether the global runoff (or freshwater discharge from land to the ocean) is currently increasing and the global water cycle is intensifying is still a controversial issue. Here we compute land–atmosphere and ocean–atmosphere water budgets and derive two independent estimates of the global runoff over the period 1993–2009. Water storage variations in the land, ocean and atmosphere reservoirs are estimated from different types of data sets: atmospheric reanalyses, land surface models, satellite altimetry and in situ ocean tem-perature data (the difference between altimetry based global mean sea level and ocean thermal expansion providing an estimate of the ocean mass component). These data sets are first validated using independent data, and then the global runoff is computed from the two methods. Results for the global runoff show a very good correlation between both es-timates. More importantly, no significant trend is observed over the whole period. Besides, the global runoff appears to be clearly impacted by large-scale climate phenomena such as major ENSO events. To infer this, we compute the zonal runoff over four latitudinal bands and set up for each band a new index (combined runoff index) obtained by optimiza-tion of linear combinations of various climate indices. Re-sults show that, in particular, the intertropical and northern mid-latitude runoffs are mainly driven by ENSO and the At-lantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) with opposite behav-ior. Indeed, the zonal runoff in the intertropical zone de-creases during major El Ni{\~{n}}o events, whereas it increases in the northern mid-latitudes, suggesting that water masses over land are shifted northward/southward during El Ni{\~{n}}o/La Ni{\~{n}}a. In addition to this study, we propose an innovative method to estimate the global ocean thermal expansion. The method is based on the assumption that the difference be-tween both runoff estimates is mainly due to the thermal ex-pansion term not accounted for in the estimation of the ocean mass. We find that our reconstructed thermal expansion time series compares well with two existing data sets in terms of year-to-year fluctuations but somewhat differs on longer (multi-year) time scales. Possible explanations include non negligible steric variations from the deep ocean.},

abstract = {The continental part of the water cycle is commonly represented with hydrological models. Yet, there are limits in their capacity to accurately estimate water storage and dynamics because of their coarse spatial resolution, simplified physics, and an incomplete knowledge of atmospheric forcing and input parameters. These errors can be diminished using data assimilation techniques. The model's most sensitive parameters should be identified beforehand. The objective of the present study is to highlight key parameters impacting the river-routing scheme Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (TRIP) while simulating river water height and discharge as a function of time focusing on the annual cycle. Thus, a sensitivity analysis based on the decomposition of model output variance (using a method called ANOVA) is utilized and applied over the Amazon basin. Tested parameters are perturbed with correcting factors. First, parameter-correcting coefficients are considered uniform over the entire basin. The results are specific to the TRIP model and show that geomorphological parameters explain around 95% of the water height variance with purely additive contributions, all year long, with a dominating impact of the river Manning coefficient (40%), the riverbed slope (35%), and the river width (20%). The results also show that discharge is essentially sensitive to the groundwater time constant that makes up more than 90% of the variance. To a lesser extent, in rising/falling flow period, the discharge is also sensitive to geomorphological parameters. Next, the Amazon basin is divided into nine subregions and the sensitivity analysis is carried out for regionalized parameter-correcting coefficients. The results show that local-region parameters impact water height, while upstream-region parameters affect discharge.},

abstract = {<p><p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Two new remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) and surface soil moisture (SSM) satellite-derived products are compared with two sets of simulations of the ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms (ORCHIDEE) and Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere, CO<sub>2</sub>-reactive (ISBA-A-gs) land surface models. We analyse the interannual variability over the period 1991–2008. The leaf onset and the length of the vegetation growing period (LGP) are derived from both the satellite-derived LAI and modelled LAI. The LGP values produced by the photosynthesis-driven phenology model of ISBA-A-gs are closer to the satellite-derived LAI and LGP than those produced by ORCHIDEE. In the latter, the phenology is based on a growing degree day model for leaf onset, and on both climatic conditions and leaf life span for senescence. Further, the interannual variability of LAI is better captured by ISBA-A-gs than by ORCHIDEE. In order to investigate how recent droughts affected vegetation over the Euro-Mediterranean area, a case study addressing the summer 2003 drought is presented. It shows a relatively good agreement of the modelled LAI anomalies with the observations, but the two models underestimate plant regrowth in the autumn. A better representation of the root-zone soil moisture profile could improve the simulations of both models. The satellite-derived SSM is compared with SSM simulations of ISBA-A-gs only, as ORCHIDEE has no explicit representation of SSM. Overall, the ISBA-A-gs simulations of SSM agree well with the satellite-derived SSM and are used to detect regions where the satellite-derived product could be improved. Finally, a correspondence is found between the interannual variability of detrended SSM and LAI. The predictability of LAI is less pronounced using remote sensing observations than using simulated variables. However, consistent results are found in July for the croplands of the Ukraine and southern Russia.</p></p>},

abstract = {Up to now, high-resolution mapping of surface water extent from satellites has only been available for a few regions, over limited time periods. The extension of the temporal and spatial coverage was difficult, due to the limitation of the remote sensing technique [e.g., the interaction of the radiation with vegetation or cloud for visible observations or the temporal sampling with the synthetic aperture radar (SAR)]. The advantages and the limitations of the various satellite techniques are reviewed. The need to have a global and consistent estimate of the water surfaces over long time periods triggered the development of a multi-satellite methodology to obtain consistent surface water all over the globe, regardless of the environments. The Global Inundation Extent from Multi-satellites (GIEMS) combines the complementary strengths of satellite observations from the visible to the microwave, to produce a low-resolution monthly dataset ((Formula presented.)) of surface water extent and dynamics. Downscaling algorithms are now developed and applied to GIEMS, using high-spatial-resolution information from visible, near-infrared, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images, or from digital elevation models. Preliminary products are available down to 500-m spatial resolution. This work bridges the gaps and prepares for the future NASA/CNES Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission to be launched in 2020. SWOT will delineate surface water extent estimates and their water storage with an unprecedented spatial resolution and accuracy, thanks to a SAR in an interferometry mode. When available, the SWOT data will be adopted to downscale GIEMS, to produce a long time series of water surfaces at global scale, consistent with the SWOT observations.},

abstract = {<p>Abstract. Recent extreme events in the Amazon River basin and the vulnerability of local population motivate the development of hydrological forecast systems using process based models for this region. In this direction, the knowledge of the source of errors in hydrological forecast systems may guide the choice on improving model structure, model forcings or developing data assimilation systems for estimation of initial model states. We evaluate the relative importance of hydrologic initial conditions and model meteorological forcings errors (precipitation) as sources of stream flow forecast uncertainty in the Amazon River basin. We used a hindcast approach that compares Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) and a reverse Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (reverse-ESP). Simulations were performed using the physically-based and distributed hydrological model MGB-IPH, comprising surface energy and water balance, soil water, river and floodplain hydrodynamics processes. The model was forced using TRMM 3B42 precipitation estimates. Results show that uncertainty on initial conditions plays an important role for discharge predictability, even for large lead times (∼1 to 3 months) on main Amazonian Rivers. Initial conditions of surface waters state variables are the major source of hydrological forecast uncertainty, mainly in rivers with low slope and large floodplains. Initial conditions of groundwater state variables are important, mostly during low flow period and in the southeast part of the Amazon where lithology and the strong rainfall seasonality with a marked dry season may be the explaining factors. Analyses indicate that hydrological forecasts based on a hydrological model forced with historical meteorological data and optimal initial conditions may be feasible. Also, development of data assimilation methods is encouraged for this region.</p>},

abstract = {Long-term gridded precipitation products are crucial for several applications in hydrology, agriculture and climate sciences. Currently available precipitation products suffer from space and time inconsistency due to the non-uniform density of ground networks and the difficulties in merging multiple satellite sensors. The recent "bottom-up" approach that exploits satellite soil moisture observations for estimating rainfall through the SM2RAIN (Soil Moisture to Rain) algorithm is suited to build a consistent rainfall data record as a single polar orbiting satellite sensor is used. Here we exploit the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on board three Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites, launched in 2006, 2012, and 2018, as part of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Polar System programme. The continuity of the scatterometer sensor is ensured until the mid-2040s through the MetOp Second Generation Programme. Therefore, by applying the SM2RAIN algorithm to ASCAT soil moisture observations, a long-term rainfall data record will be obtained, starting in 2007 and lasting until the mid-2040s. The paper describes the recent improvements in data pre-processing, SM2RAIN algorithm formulation, and data post-processing for obtaining the SM2RAIN-ASCAT quasi-global (only over land) daily rainfall data record at a 12.5 km spatial sampling from 2007 to 2018. The quality of the SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record is assessed on a regional scale through comparison with high-quality ground networks in Europe, the United States, India, and Australia. Moreover, an assessment on a global scale is provided by using the triple-collocation (TC) technique allowing us also to compare these data with the latest, fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5), the Early Run version of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), and the gauge-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) products. Results show that the SM2RAIN-ASCAT rainfall data record performs relatively well at both a regional and global scale, mainly in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) when compared to other products. Specifically, the SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record provides performance better than IMERG and GPCC in data-scarce regions of the world, such as Africa and South America. In these areas, we expect larger benefits in using SM2RAIN-ASCAT for hydrological and agricultural applications. The limitations of the SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record consist of the underestimation of peak rainfall events and the presence of spurious rainfall events due to high-frequency soil moisture fluctuations that might be corrected in the future with more advanced bias correction techniques. The SM2RAIN-ASCAT data record is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3405563 (Brocca et al., 2019) (recently extended to the end of August 2019).},

abstract = {Recent comparisons of a number of general circulation models (GCMs) have shown that most of them have deficiencies in the simulation of the diurnal cycle of warm season precipitation. The deficiencies are particularly pronounced over the United States Great Plains where the models generally fail to capture the nocturnal rainfall maximum found in the observations. By using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's Global Forecasting System (NCEP GFS) GCM, which is unusual in that it produces a realistic nocturnal rainfall signal over the Great Plains, this study examines the nature and realism of the mechanisms responsible for the nocturnal rain in the GCM. A series of sensitivity experiments highlight the importance of triggers implemented in the convection scheme. Specifically, the convection trigger function that the cloud base (defined as the level of free convection) must be within 150 hPa depth from the convection starting level (which crudely represents an upper limit of convective inhibition) plays a key role on the realistic simulation of the diurnal phase of convection. On the basis of this trigger, the nighttime elevation of the convection starting level (defined as the maximum level of moist static energy from the surface) above the boundary layer inversion provides the condition favorable for the development of nocturnal precipitation over the Great Plains. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for improving our understanding and parameterizations of the physical processes that generate nocturnal rain in this and other regions with large diurnal cycles.},

abstract = {Rainfall measurements by conventional raingauges provide relatively accurate estimates at a few points of a region. The actual rainfield can be approximated by interpolating the available raingauge data to the remaining of the area of interest. In places with relatively low gauge density such interpolated rainfields will be very rough estimates of the actual events. This is especially true for tropical regions where most rainfall has a convective origin with high spatial variability at the daily level. Estimates of rainfall by remote sensing can be very useful in regions such as the Amazon basin, where raingauge density is very low and rainfall highly variable. This paper evaluates the rainfall estimates of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite over the Tapaj{\'{o}}s river basin, a major tributary of the Amazon. Three-hour TRMM rainfall estimates were aggregated to daily values and were compared with catch of ground-level precipitation gauges on a daily basis after interpolating both data to a regular grid. Both daily TRMM and raingauge-interpolated rainfields were then used as input to a large-scale hydrological model for the whole basin; the calculated hydrographs were then compared to observations at several streamgauges along the river Tapajos and its main tributaries. Results of the rainfield comparisons showed that satellite estimates can be a practical tool for identifying damaged or aberrant raingauges at a basin-wide scale. Results of the hydrological modeling showed that TRMM-based calculated hydrographs are comparable with those obtained using raingauge data. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This study quantifies the terrestrial water budget with reanalysis, hydrologic modeling, remote sensing, and in situ observations and shows there is significant uncertainty in the estimates of precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and terrestrial water storage changes. The spread among the various datasets highlights the scientific community's inability to accurately characterize the hydroclimatology of this region, which is problematic because much attention has focused on hydrologic trends using these datasets.

abstract = {We describe the construction of a new version of the Europe-wide E-OBS temperature (daily minimum, mean, and maximum values) and precipitation data set. This version provides an improved estimation of interpolation uncertainty through the calculation of a 100-member ensemble of realizations of each daily field. The data set covers the period back to 1950 and provides gridded fields at a spacing of 0.25∘ × 0.25∘ in regular latitude/longitude coordinates. As with the original E-OBS data set, the ensemble version is based on the station series collated as part of the ECA&D initiative. Station density varies significantly over the domain, and over time, and a reliable estimation of interpolation uncertainty in the gridded fields is therefore important for users of the data set. The uncertainty quantified by the ensemble data set is more realistic than the uncertainty estimates in the original version, although uncertainty is still underestimated in data-sparse regions. The new data set is compared against the earlier version of E-OBS and against regional gridded data sets produced by a selection of National Meteorological Services. In terms of both climatological averages and extreme values, the new version of E-OBS is broadly comparable to the earlier version. Nonetheless, users will notice differences between the two E-OBS versions, especially for precipitation, which arises from the different gridding method used.},

abstract = {The regions where the divergence of vertically integrated water vapor flux, averaged over a season or a year, is positive (negative) are sources (sinks) of moisture for the atmosphere. An aerial river is defined as a stream of strong water vapor flux connecting a source and a sink. Moisture flux, its divergence, and sources and sinks over the tropics of South and Central America and the adjoining Atlantic Ocean are obtained for dry years and for wet years in the Amazon Basin. Results show that the Amazon Basin is a sink region for atmospheric moisture in all seasons and that there are two source regions for the moisture in the basin, one situated in the South Atlantic and the other in the North Atlantic, both located equator-ward of the respective subtropical high-pressure centers. The convergence of moisture increases over the Amazon Basin in austral summer, and at the same time it decreases in the Pacific and Atlantic ITCZs. Box model calculations reveal that the wet years, on the average, present about 55 % more moisture convergence than the dry years in the Amazon Basin. A reduction in the moisture inflow across the eastern and northern boundaries of the basin (at 45°W and at the Equator, respectively) and an increase in the outflow across the southern boundary (at 15°S) lead to dry conditions. The annual mean contribution of moisture convergence to the precipitation over the Amazon Basin is estimated to be 70 %. In the dry years, it lowers to around 50 %. The net convergence of water vapor flux over the basin is a good indicator of the wet or dry condition. {\textcopyright}2012 Springer-Verlag.},

In particular we aim to better understand the combination of the local and regional mechanisms controlling the diurnal cycle of summertime (DJF) precipitation in the Northern Central Andes (NCA) region of Southern Peru. A climatology of the diurnal cycle is obtained from 15 wet seasons (2000–2014) of 3-hourly TRMM-3B42 data (0.25° × 0.25°) and swath data from the TRMM-2A25 precipitation radar product (5 km × 5 km). The main findings are: (1) in the NCA region, the diurnal cycle shows a maximum precipitation occurring during the day (night) in the western (eastern) side of the Andes highlands, (2) in the valleys of the Cuzco region and in the Amazon slope of the Andes the maximum (minimum) precipitation occurs during the night (day). The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) regional atmospheric model is used to simulate the mean diurnal cycle in the NCA region for the same period at 27 km and 9 km horizontal grid spacing and 3-hourly output, and at 3 km only for the month of January 2010 in the Cuzco valleys. Sensitivity experiments were also performed to investigate the effect of the topography on the observed rainfall patterns. The model reproduces the main diurnal precipitation features. The main atmospheric processes identified are: (1) the presence of a regional-scale cyclonic circulation strengthening during the afternoon, (2) diurnal thermally driven circulations at local scale, including upslope (downslope) wind and moisture transport during the day (night), (3) channelization of the upslope moisture transport from the Amazon along the Apurimac valleys toward the western part of the cordillera.},

abstract = {The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission planned for launch in 2020 will map river elevations and inundated area globally for rivers >100 m wide. In advance of this launch, we here evaluated the possibility of estimating discharge in ungauged rivers using synthetic, daily “remote sensing” measurements derived from hydraulic models corrupted with minimal observational errors. Five discharge algorithms were evaluated, as well as the median of the five, for 19 rivers spanning a range of hydraulic and geomorphic conditions. Reliance upon a priori information, and thus applicability to truly ungauged reaches, varied among algorithms: one algorithm employed only global limits on velocity and depth, while the other algorithms relied on globally available prior estimates of discharge. We found at least one algorithm able to estimate instantaneous discharge to within 35% relative root-mean-squared error (RRMSE) on 14/16 nonbraided rivers despite out-of-bank flows, multichannel planforms, and backwater effects. Moreover, we found RRMSE was often dominated by bias; the median standard deviation of relative residuals across the 16 nonbraided rivers was only 12.5%. SWOT discharge algorithm progress is therefore encouraging, yet future efforts should consider incorporating ancillary data or multialgorithm synergy to improve results.},

The 2003 excess terrestrial water storage depletion observed from GRACE can be related to the record-breaking heat wave that occurred in central Europe in 2003. We validate the measurements from GRACE using two independent hydrological estimates and direct gravity observations from superconducting gravimeters in Europe. All datasets agree well with the GRACE measurements despite the disparity of the employed information; the difference between datasets tends to be within GRACE margin of error.

abstract = {[1] The aim of this study is to produce future scenarios on the river inputs of water and nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) into the Mediterranean and Black Sea. They are based on the four contrasting scenarios that were developed by the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) for the years 2030 and 2050 and implemented in a spatially explicit manner into the IMAGE model. We first identified the major drivers of the river fluxes by regression analyses, then tested the retained models against the past evolutions between 1970 and 2000, and finally applied the models to the MEA scenarios. For nutrients, the considered river data mainly refer to the large rivers for which long‐term time series exist (Rhone, Po, Ebro, and Danube). Here, recent trends were principally driven by fertilizer spreads (NO 3 , PO 4), together with urban wastewater releases (PO 4). Future trends remain in the envelope of the observed variability during the last 40 years, both for the large rivers and, when extrapolated to the basin scales, also for the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea. At regional scales, however, the budgets considerably change. In the northern parts of the Mediterranean drainage basin, they uniformly tend to decrease, but they may strongly increase in the south and east. Water discharge is examined on a basis of 37 rivers, showing that this parameter is clearly linked to the evolution of climate. Because of the ongoing evolution toward dryer and warmer conditions, we predict a significant trend of decreasing freshwater fluxes for the future, which already started in the past. Regional hot spots for this decrease are the drainage basin of the Alboran Sea and, when also considering the inhabitant specific water fluxes, the basins of the Aegean and north Levantine seas.},

The products, coming from land surface models, reanalysis, and remote sensing, are chosen from sources that are readily available to the community of users. The results show that the spatial patterns of maximum uncertainty differ among metrics, with dry regions showing maximum relative uncertainties of annual mean evapotranspiration, while energy-limited regions present maximum uncertainties in the representation of the annual cycle and monsoon regions in the representation of anomalous conditions. Furthermore, it is found that land surface models driven by observed atmospheric fields detect meteorological and agricultural droughts in dry regions unequivocally. The remote sensing products employed do not distinguish all agricultural droughts and this could be attributed to the forcing net radiation. The study also highlights important characteristics of individual data sets and recommends users to include assessments of sensitivity to evapotranspiration data sets in their studies, depending on region and nature of study to be conducted.},

abstract = {Global climate models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs) generally show a decrease in the dry season evapotranspiration (ET) rate over the entire Amazon basin. Based on anecdotal observations, it has been suggested that they probably overestimate tropical rain forest water stress. In this study, eddy covariance flux measurements from eight different towers of the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) were used to provide a first look at the spatial variability and temporal cycle of ET throughout the basin. Results show strong seasonality in ET for stations near the equator (2°-3°S), with ET increasing during the dry season (June-September) and decreasing during the wet season (December-March), both correlated (0.75 to 0.94) and in phase with the net radiation annual cycle. In stations located farther south (9°-11°S) no clear seasonality could be identified in either net radiation or ET. For these more southerly stations, net radiation and ET are still correlated (0.76-0.92) in the wet season, but correlations decrease in the dry season (0-0.71), which is likely associated with water stress. For both pasture sites, located in southern Amazonia, ET decreases during the second half of the dry season, indicating progressively increased water stress. GCMs and RCMs indeed tend to overestimate dry season water stress in the Amazon basin and, therefore, should be revised to better simulate this region, which has a key role in the global hydrometeorology. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

One year (August 1998-July 1999) of tropical rainfall estimates from the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) systems were used to produce monthly means of rainfall diurnal cycles at hourly and 1° × 1° scales over a domain (30°S-30°N, 80°E-10°W) from the Americas across the Pacific Ocean to Australia and eastern Asia. The results demonstrate pronounced diurnal variability of tropical rainfall intensity at synoptic and regional scales. Seasonal signals of diurnal rainfall are presented over the large domain of the tropical Pacific Ocean, especially over the ITCZ and South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) and neighboring continents. The regional patterns of tropical rainfall diurnal cycles are specified in the Amazon, Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, Calcutta, Bay of Bengal, Malaysia, and northern Australia. Limited validations for the results include comparisons of 1) the PERSIANN-derived diurnal cycle of rainfall at Rondonia, Brazil, with that derived from the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) radar data; 2) the PERSIANN diurnal cycle of rainfall over the western Pacific Ocean with that derived from the data of the optical rain gauges mounted on the TOGA-moored buoys: and 3) the monthly accumulations of rainfall samples from the orbital TMI and PR surface rainfall with the accumulations of concurrent PERSIANN estimates. These comparisons indicate that the PERSIANN-derived diurnal patterns at the selected resolutions produce estimates that are similar in magnitude and phase.},

abstract = {<p><![CDATA[Abstract. A traditional metric used in hydrology to summarize model performance is the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Increasingly an alternative metric, the Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE), is used instead. When NSE is used, NSE = 0 corresponds to using the mean flow as a benchmark predictor. The same reasoning is applied in various studies that use KGE as a metric: negative KGE values are viewed as bad model performance, and only positive values are seen as good model performance. Here we show that using the mean flow as a predictor does not result in KGE = 0, but instead KGE =1-√2≈-0.41. Thus, KGE values greater than −0.41 indicate that a model improves upon the mean flow benchmark – even if the model's KGE value is negative. NSE and KGE values cannot be directly compared, because their relationship is non-unique and depends in part on the coefficient of variation of the observed time series. Therefore, modellers who use the KGE metric should not let their understanding of NSE values guide them in interpreting KGE values and instead develop new understanding based on the constitutive parts of the KGE metric and the explicit use of benchmark values to compare KGE scores against. More generally, a strong case can be made for moving away from ad hoc use of aggregated efficiency metrics and towards a framework based on purpose-dependent evaluation metrics and benchmarks that allows for more robust model adequacy assessment.]]></p>},

This novel approach analyzes climate extreme events over the past four decades (1980–2016) using multiple gridded observation and reanalysis datasets. Furthermore, future changes in climate extremes are analyzed from 20 downscaled Earth System Models (ESMs) at high horizontal resolution (0.25° of latitude/longitude), under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Projected changes in the extreme indices are analyzed over mid-twenty-first century (2046–2065) and end-of-twenty-first century (2081–2100) relative to the reference period 1986–2005. Results show consistent warming patterns with increasing (decreasing) trends in warm (cold) extremes in the historical datasets. A similar but more intense warm pattern is projected in the mid and end of the twenty-first century. For precipitation indices, observations show an increase in consecutive dry days and a reduction of consecutive wet days over almost all Brazil. The frequency and intensity of extremely wet days over Brazil are expected to increase according to future scenarios. Designing effective adaptation and mitigation measures in response to changes in climate extremes events depends on this improved understanding of how conditions have and are likely to change in the future at regional scales.},

abstract = {Commencement of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provides an alternative way to monitor changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) at large scales. However, GRACE dataset spans from 2002 to present, which greatly limits the application of GRACE data for long-term hydrological studies. Thus, the general linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) methods were used to reconstruct the time series of terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA, i.e., remove the average value from the time series) in Northwest China (NWC) during 1948–2002 based on the GRACE TWSA during 2003–2015 and hydrological data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) during 1948–2010. The results showed that soil moisture (SM) anomalies, or the combination of SM, canopy water (CW), and snow water equivalent (SWE) anomalies were better than the other anomalies of GLDAS in NWC. RF method can be regarded as the optimal method to reconstruct TWSA in NWC in the four models. A negative relationship was found between the reconstructed TWSAs and El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The method could also offer an approach to reconstruct TWSA and drought events in large river basins during the past several decades.},

abstract = {<p>Abstract. The total water storage change (TWSC) over land is a major component of the global water cycle, with a large influence on the climate variability, sea level budget and water resource availability for human life. Its first estimates at a large scale were made available with GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) observations for the 2002–2016 period, followed since 2018 by the launch of the GRACE-FO (Follow-On) mission. In this paper, using an approach based on the water mass conservation rule, we propose to merge satellite-based observations of precipitation and evapotranspiration with in situ river discharge measurements to estimate TWSC over longer time periods (typically from 1980 to 2016), compatible with climate studies. We performed this task over five major Asian basins, subject to both large climate variability and strong anthropogenic pressure for water resources and for which long-term records of in situ discharge measurements are available. Our Satellite Water Cycle (SAWC) reconstruction provides TWSC estimates very coherent in terms of seasonal and interannual variations with independent sources of information such as (1) TWSC GRACE-derived observations (over the 2002–2015 period), (2) ISBA-CTRIP (Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere CNRM – Centre National de Recherches M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}orologiques – Total Runoff Integrating Pathways) model simulations (1980–2015) and (3) the multi-satellite inundation extent (1993–2007). This analysis shows the advantages of the use of multiple satellite-derived datasets along with in situ data to perform a hydrologically coherent reconstruction of a missing water component estimate. It provides a new critical source of information for the long-term monitoring of TWSC and to better understand its critical role in the global and terrestrial water cycle.</p>},

abstract = {The scarcity of groundwater storage change data at the global scale hinders our ability to monitor groundwater resources effectively. In this study, we assimilate a state-of-the-art terrestrial water storage product derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations into NASA's Catchment land surface model (CLSM) at the global scale, with the goal of generating groundwater storage time series that are useful for drought monitoring and other applications. Evaluation using in situ data from nearly 4,000 wells shows that GRACE data assimilation improves the simulation of groundwater, with estimation errors reduced by 36% and 10% and correlation improved by 16% and 22% at the regional and point scales, respectively. The biggest improvements are observed in regions with large interannual variability in precipitation, where simulated groundwater responds too strongly to changes in atmospheric forcing. The positive impacts of GRACE data assimilation are further demonstrated using observed low-flow data. CLSM and GRACE data assimilation performance is also examined across different permeability categories. The evaluation reveals that GRACE data assimilation fails to compensate for the lack of a groundwater withdrawal scheme in CLSM when it comes to simulating realistic groundwater variations in regions with intensive groundwater abstraction. CLSM-simulated groundwater correlates strongly with 12-month precipitation anomalies in low-latitude and midlatitude areas. A groundwater drought indicator based on GRACE data assimilation generally agrees with other regional-scale drought indicators, with discrepancies mainly in their estimated drought severity.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall are governed by complex interactions between climate and landscape perturbations including deforestation, fire, and drought. Previous research demonstrated that rainfall in portions of the Amazon Basin has intensified, resulting in more extreme droughts and floods. The basin has global impacts on climate and hydrologic cycles; thus, it is critical to understand how precipitation patterns and intensity are changing. Due to insufficient precipitation gauges, we analyzed the variability and seasonality of rainfall over the Amazon Basin from 1982 to 2018 using high-resolution gridded precipitation products. We developed several precipitation indices and analyzed their trends using the Mann–Kendall test (Mann 1945; Kendall, 1975) to identify significant changes in rainfall patterns over time and space. Our results show landscape scale changes in the timing and intensity of rainfall events. Specifically, wet areas of the western Basin have become significantly wetter since 1982, with an increase of 182 mm of rainfall per year. In the eastern and southern regions, where deforestation is widespread, a significant drying trend is evident. Additionally, local alterations to precipitation patterns were also observed. For example, the Tocantins region has had a significant increase in the number of dry days during both wet and dry seasons, increasing by about 1 day per year. Surprisingly, changes in rainfall amount and number of dry days do not consistently align. Broadly, over this 37-year period, wet areas are trending wetter and dry areas are trending drier, while spatial anomalies show structure at the scale of hundreds of kilometers.},

Only two space-borne L-band sensors are currently operating: SMOS, launched end of 2009 and thus providing now a 10-year global data set and SMAP, launched beginning of 2015. This study provides a state-of-the-art scientific overview of the SMOS-IC retrieval data set based on the SMOS L-band observations. This SMOS product aims at improved performance and independence of auxiliary data, key features for robust applications. The SMOS-IC product includes both a soil moisture (SM) and a L-band vegetation optical depth (L-VOD) data set which are currently at the basis of several studies evaluating the impact of climate and anthropogenic activities on aboveground carbon stocks. Since the release of the first version, the algorithm has been significantly changed in support to key applications, but no document is available to report these changes. This paper fills this gap by analyzing key science questions related to the product development, reviewing application results and presenting an extensive description of the last version of the product (version 2) considering changes in comparison to the previous version (V105). For the future it is planned to merge the SMOS and SMAP L-VOD data sets to ensure L-VOD data continuity in the event of failure of one of the space-borne SMOS or SMAP sensors.},

abstract = {Rainfall variability in the Amazon basin (AB) is analysed for the 1964-2003 period. It is based on 756 pluviometric stations distributed throughout the AB countries. For the first time it includes data from Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. In particular, the recent availability of rainfall data from the Andean countries makes it possible to complete previous studies. The impact of mountain ranges on rainfall is pointed out. The highest rainfall in the AB is observed in low windward regions, and low rainfall is measured in leeward and elevated stations. Additionally, rainfall regimes are more diversified in the Andean regions than in the lowlands. Rainfall spatio-temporal variability is studied based on a varimax-rotated principal component analysis (PCA). Long-term variability with a decreasing rainfall since the 1980s prevails in June-July-August (JJA) and September-October-November (SON). During the rainiest seasons, i.e. December-January-February (DJF) and March-April-May (MAM), the main variability is at decadal and interannual time scales. Interdecadal variability is related to long-term changes in the Pacific Ocean, whereas decadal variability, opposing the northwest and the south of the AB, is associated with changes in the strength of the low-level jet (LLJ) along the Andes. Interannual variability characterizes more specifically the northeast of the basin and the southern tropical Andes. It is related to El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and to the sea surface temperature (SST) gradient over the tropical Atlantic. Mean rainfall in the basin decreases during the 1975-2003 period at an annual rate estimated to be -0.32%. Break tests show that this decrease has been particularly important since 1982. Further insights into this phenomenon will permit to identify the impact of climate on the hydrology of the AB. {\textcopyright} 2008 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Large-scale runoff routing models (RRMs) are important as a validation tool for GCMs, and to close the hydrological cycle in fully-coupled climate models. The model RiTHM was developed to simulate the discharge of large rivers from the total runoff simulated by the LMD GCM. It uses a 1024×800 grid, nested in the 64×50 grid of the LMD GCM. The runoff simulated in a GCM grid cell is uniformly distributed over the underlying cells, where a series of two reservoirs accounts for the delay related to infiltration through the unsaturated zone and aquifers. The resulting riverflow is routed assuming pure translation along the drainage network, extracted with a GIS from a 5 min DEM. The transfer time from a cell to the outlet depends on topography, and on a basin-wide parameter, the time of concentration. RiTHM was calibrated in 11 river basins, using a realistic runoff forcing (computed by the land surface model SECHIBA from reanalyzed meteorological forcing). This led to a very satisfactory reproduction of observed hydrographs. The main problems were related to hydraulic processes neglected in RiTHM (reservoirs, diversion of riverflow because of flooding or irrigation). These results helped to validate SECHIBA, except for its snow processes, shown to be too simple. With the same parameters, RiTHM was also forced with runoff from the LMD GCM. This induced an important degradation of the simulated hydrographs, regarding both volume and timing. It was largely explained by errors in precipitation, and more generally climate, in the GCM. The direct calibration of RiTHM under the GCM-runoff forcing markedly improved the timing of simulated discharge, which could be interesting for land–atmosphere–ocean coupling. This work demonstrated that the usefulness of RRMs for GCMs strongly depends on their adequate calibration.},

abstract = {As the U.S. Science Team's globally gridded precipitation product from the NASA–JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) estimates the surface precipitation rates at 0.18 every half hour using spaceborne sensors for various scientific and societal applications. One key component of IMERG is the morphing algorithm, which uses motion vectors to perform quasi-Lagrangian interpolation to fill in gaps in the passive microwave precipitation field using motion vectors. Up to IMERG V05, the motion vectors were derived from the large-scale motions of infrared observations of cloud tops. This study details the changes introduced in IMERG V06 to derive motion vectors from large-scale motions of selected atmospheric variables in numerical models, which allow IMERG estimates to be extended from the 608N–608S latitude band to the entire globe. Evaluation against both instantaneous passive microwave retrievals and ground measurements demonstrates the general improvement in the precipitation field of the new approach. Most of the model variables tested exhibited similar performance, but total precipitable water vapor was chosen as the source of the motion vectors for IMERG V06 due to its competitive performance and global completeness. Continuing assessments will provide further insights into possible refinements of this revised morphing scheme in future versions of IMERG.},

abstract = {AbstractSince 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has provided gravity-derived observations of variations in the terrestrial water storage. Because of the lack of suitable direct observations of large-scale water storage changes, a validation of the GRACE observations remains difficult. An approach that allows the evaluation of terrestrial water storage variations from GRACE by a comparison with those derived from aerologic water budgets using the atmospheric moisture flux divergence is presented. In addition to reanalysis products from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, high-resolution regional atmospheric simulations were produced with the Weather Research and Forecast modeling system (WRF) and validated against globally gridded observational data of precipitation and 2-m temperature.

abstract = {The Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a recently developed technique for component extraction. This new method requires the statistical independence of the extracted components{\textemdash}a stronger constraint that uses higher-order statistics{\textemdash}instead of the classical decorrelation (in the sense of {\textquotedblleft}no correlation{\textquotedblright}), which is a weaker constraint that uses only second-order statistics. This technique has been used recently for the analysis of geophysical time series with the goal of investigating the causes of variability in observed data (i.e., exploratory approach). The authors demonstrate with a data simulation experiment that, if initialized with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the ICA performs a rotation of the classical PCA (or EOF) solution. This experiment is conducted using a synthetic dataset, where the correct answer is known, to more clearly illustrate and understand the behavior of the more familiar PCA and less familiar ICA. This rotation uses no localization criterion like other rotation techniques; only the generalization of decorrelation into full statistical independence is used. This rotation of the PCA solution seems to be able to avoid the tendency of PCA to mix several components, even when the signal is just their linear sum.},

abstract = {In this study, rating curves (RCs) were determined by applying satellite altimetry to a poorly gauged basin. This study demonstrates the synergistic application of remote sensing and watershed modeling to capture the dynamics and quantity of flow in the Amazon River Basin, respectively. Three major advancements for estimating basin-scale patterns in river discharge are described. The first advancement is the preservation of the hydrological meanings of the parameters expressed by Manning's equation to obtain a data set containing the elevations of the river beds throughout the basin. The second advancement is the provision of parameter uncertainties and, therefore, the uncertainties in the rated discharge. The third advancement concerns estimating the discharge while considering backwater effects. We analyzed the Amazon Basin using nearly one thousand series that were obtained from ENVISAT and Jason-2 altimetry for more than 100 tributaries. Discharge values and related uncertainties were obtained from the rain-discharge MGB-IPH model. We used a global optimization algorithm based on the Monte Carlo Markov Chain and Bayesian framework to determine the rating curves. The data were randomly allocated into 80% calibration and 20% validation subsets. A comparison with the validation samples produced a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (Ens) of 0.68. When the MGB discharge uncertainties were less than 5%, the Ens value increased to 0.81 (mean). A comparison with the in situ discharge resulted in an Ens value of 0.71 for the validation samples (and 0.77 for calibration). The Ens values at the mouths of the rivers that experienced backwater effects significantly improved when the mean monthly slope was included in the RC. Our RCs were not mission-dependent, and the Ens value was preserved when applying ENVISAT rating curves to Jason-2 altimetry at crossovers. The cease-to-flow parameter of our RCs provided a good proxy for determining river bed elevation. This proxy was validated against Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) cross sections with an accuracy of more than 90%. Altimetry measurements are routinely delivered within a few days, and this RC data set provides a simple and cost-effective tool for predicting discharge throughout the basin in nearly real time.},

abstract = {SummaryWe have applied a methodology for estimating the source regions of evaporation supplying precipitation over specific regions to the areas of most of the nations of the world. The methodology has been used in the past to estimate recycling ratios and the surface sources of moisture supplying rainfall over specific river basins. Extension to nations is straightforward, and we have incorporated other demographic information to gain a new viewpoint on the linkages between nations through the atmospheric branch of the hydrologic cycle. We find that nations with the highest recycling ratio, when scaled to a common area, have a combination of mountainous terrain, humid climate, or are at high latitudes. Nations with the lowest scaled recycling ratio are usually arid or semi-arid and on the coast. Small landlocked nations are most likely to receive most of their precipitation from the evaporation of the territories of other nations. "Moisture independence" is greatest for large isolated nations. Nations that import a majority of their precipitating moisture from other countries who rank lower in terms per capita precipitation, i.e., more "water-poor" nations, tend not to be economically rich themselves, but are often also poor nations possessing lower population densities than their neighbors.},

abstract = {[1] This study uses a Bayesian approach to merge ensemble seasonal climate forecasts generated by multiple climate models for better probabilistic and deterministic forecasting. Within the Bayesian framework, the climatological distribution of the variable of interest serves as the prior, and the likelihood function is developed with a weighted linear regression between the climate model hindcasts and the corresponding observations. The resulting posterior distribution is the merged forecast, which represents our best estimate of the variable, including its mean and variance, given the current model forecast and knowledge about the model's performance. The handling of multimodel climate forecasts and nonnormal distributed variables, such as precipitation, are two important extensions toward the application of the Bayesian merging approach for seasonal hydrological predictions. Two examples are presented as follows: seasonal forecast of sea surface temperature over equatorial Pacific and precipitation forecast over the Ohio River basin. Cross validation of these forecasts shows smaller root mean square error and smaller ranked probability score for the merged forecast as compared with raw forecasts from climate models and the climatological forecast, indicating an improvement in both deterministic and probabilistic forecast skills. Therefore there is great potential to apply this method to seasonal hydrological forecasting. Citation: Luo, L., E. F. Wood, and M.

abstract = {We describe a simple technique for the acceleration of spectro-polarimetric inversions based on principal component analysis (PCA) of Stokes profiles. This technique involves the indexing of the database models based on the sign of the projections (PCA coefficients) of the first few relevant orders of principal components of the four Stokes parameters. In this way, each model in the database can be attributed a distinctive binary number of 24n bits, where n is the number of PCA orders used for the indexing. Each of these binary numbers (indexes) identifies a group of "compatible" models for the inversion of a given set of observed Stokes profiles sharing the same index. The complete set of the binary numbers so constructed evidently determines a partition of the database. The search of the database for the PCA inversion of spectro-polarimetric data can profit greatly from this indexing. In practical cases it becomes possible to approach the ideal acceleration factor of 24n as compared to the systematic search of a non-indexed database for a traditional PCA inversion. This indexing method relies on the existence of a physical meaning in the sign of the PCA coefficients of a model. For this reason, the presence of model ambiguities and of spectro-polarimetric noise in the observations limits in practice the number n of relevant PCA orders that can be used for the indexing.},

abstract = {The amount of water stored and moving through the surface water bodies of large river basins (river, floodplains, wetlands) plays a major role in the global water and biochemical cycles and is a critical parameter for water resources management. However, the spatiotemporal variations of these freshwater reservoirs are still widely unknown at the global scale. Here, we propose a hypsographic curve approach to estimate surface freshwater storage variations over the Amazon basin combining surface water extent from a multi-satellite- technique with topographic data from the Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) from Advance Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Monthly surface water storage variations for 1993-2007 are presented, showing a strong seasonal and interannual variability, and are evaluated against in situ river discharge and precipitation. The basin-scale mean annual amplitude of ∼1200 km3 is in the range of previous estimates and contributes to about half of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) total water storage variations. For the first time, we map the surface water volume anomaly during the extreme droughts of 1997 (October-November) and 2005 (September-October) and found that during these dry events the water stored in the river and floodplains of the Amazon basin was, respectively, ∼230 (∼40%) and 210 (∼50%) km3 below the 1993-2007 average. This new 15 year data set of surface water volume represents an unprecedented source of information for future hydrological or climate modeling of the Amazon. It is also a first step toward the development of such database at the global scale.

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite gravity mission provides a new capability for measuring extreme climate events, such as floods and droughts associated with large-scale terrestrial water storage (TWS) change. GRACE gravity measurements show significant TWS increases in the lower Amazon basin in the first half of 2009, clearly associated with the exceptional flood season in that region. The extended record of GRACE monthly gravity solutions reveals the temporal and spatial evolution of both nonseasonal and interannual TWS change in the Amazon basin over the 7 year mission period from April 2002 to August 2009. GRACE observes a very dry season in 2002-2003 and an extremely wet season in 2009. In March 2009 (approximately the peak of the recent Amazon flood), total TWS surplus in the entire Amazon basin is ∼624 32 Gt, roughly equal to U.S. water consumption for a year. GRACE measurements are consistent with precipitation data. Interannual TWS changes in the Amazon basin are closely connected to ENSO events in the tropical Pacific. The 2002-2003 dry season is clearly tied to the 2002-2003 El Nio and the 2009 flood to the recent La Nia event. The most significant contribution of this study in the area of water resources is to confront the hydrological community with the latest results of the GRACE satellite mission and further demonstrates the unique strength of GRACE and follow-up satellite gravity observations for measuring large-scale extreme climate events.

abstract = {Satellite Earth observations (EO) are an accurate and reliable data source for atmospheric and environmental science. Their increasing spatial and temporal resolution, as well as the seamless availability over ungauged regions, make them appealing for hydrological modeling. This work shows recent advances in the use of high-resolution satellite-based 15 Earth observation data in hydrological modelling. In a set of experiments, the distributed hydrological model Continuum is set up for the Po River Basin (Italy) and forced, in turn, by satellite precipitation and evaporation, while satellite-derived soil moisture and snow depths are ingested into the model structure through a data-assimilation scheme. Further, satellite-based estimates of precipitation, evaporation and river discharge are used for hydrological model calibration, and results are compared with those based on ground observations. Despite the high density of conventional ground measurements and the 20 strong human influence in the focus region, all satellite products show strong potential for operational hydrological applications, with skillful estimates of river discharge throughout the model domain. Satellite-based evaporation and snow depths marginally improve (by 2% and 4%) the mean Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) at 27 river gauges, compared to a baseline simulation (KGEmean=0.51) forced by high-quality conventional data. Precipitation has the largest impact on the model output, though the satellite dataset on average shows poorer skills compared to conventional data. Interestingly, a 25 model calibration heavily relying on satellite data, as opposed to conventional data, provides a skillful reconstruction of river discharges, paving the way to fully satellite-driven hydrological applications.},

abstract = {The seasonal cycle of the intraseasonal (IS) variability of precipitation in South America is described through the analysis of bandpass filtered outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies. The analysis is discriminated between short (10–30 days) and long (30–90 days) intraseasonal timescales. The seasonal cycle of the 30–90-day IS variability can be well described by the activity of first leading pattern (EOF1) computed separately for the wet season (October–April) and the dry season (May–September). In agreement with previous works, the EOF1 spatial distribution during the wet season is that of a dipole with centers of actions in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) and southeastern South America (SESA), while during the dry season, only the last center is discernible. In both seasons, the pattern is highly influenced by the activity of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). Moreover, EOF1 is related with a tropical zonal-wavenumber-1 structure superposed with coherent wave trains extended along the South Pacific during the wet season, while during the dry season the wavenumber-1 structure is not observed. The 10–30-day IS variability of OLR in South America can be well represented by the activity of the EOF1 computed through considering all seasons together, a dipole but with the stronger center located over SESA. While the convection activity at the tropical band does not seem to influence its activity, there are evidences that the atmospheric variability at subtropical-extratropical regions might have a role. Subpolar wavetrains are observed in the Pacific throughout the year and less intense during DJF, while a path of wave energy dispersion along a subtropical wavetrain also characterizes the other seasons. Further work is needed to identify the sources of the 10–30-day-IS variability in South America.},

abstract = {<p>The El Ni{\~{n}}o and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurrence can be usually explained by two views of (i) a self-sustained oscillatory mode and (ii) a stable mode interacting with high-frequency forcing such as westerly wind bursts and Madden-Julian Oscillation events. The positive ocean–atmosphere feedback in the tropical Pacific hypothesized by Bjerknes leads the ENSO event to a mature phase. After ENSO event matures, negative feedbacks are needed to cease the ENSO anomaly growth. Four negative feedbacks have been proposed: (i) reflected Kelvin waves at the ocean western boundary, (ii) a discharge process due to Sverdrup transport, (iii) western-Pacific wind-forced Kelvin waves and (iv) anomalous zonal advections and wave reflection at the ocean eastern boundary. These four ENSO mechanisms are respectively called the delayed oscillator, the recharge–discharge oscillator, the western-Pacific oscillator and the advective–reflective oscillator. The unified oscillator is developed by including all ENSO mechanisms, i.e. all four ENSO oscillators are special cases of the unified oscillator. The tropical Pacific Ocean and atmosphere interaction can also induce coupled slow westward- and eastward-propagating modes. An advantage of the coupled slow modes is that they can be used to explain the propagating property of interannual anomalies, whereas the oscillatory modes produce a standing oscillation. The research community has recently paid attention to different types of ENSO events by focusing on the central-Pacific El Ni{\~{n}}o. All of the ENSO mechanisms may work for the central-Pacific El Ni{\~{n}}o events, with an addition that the central-Pacific El Ni{\~{n}}o may be related to forcing or processes in the extra-tropical Pacific.</p>},

abstract = {A systematic method is proposed to optimally combine estimates of the terrestrial water budget from different data sources and to enforce the water balance constraint using data assimilation techniques. The method is applied to create global long-term records of the terrestrial water budget by merging a number of global datasets including in situ observations, remote sensing retrievals, land surface model simulations, and global reanalyses. The estimation process has three steps. First, a conventional analysis on the errors and biases in different data sources is conducted based on existing validation/error studies and other information such as sensor network density, model physics, and calibration procedures. Then, the data merging process combines different estimates so that biases and errors from different data sources can be compensated to the greatest extent and the merged estimates have the best possible confidence. Finally, water balance errors are resolved using the constrained Kalman filter technique. The procedure is applied to 32 globally distributed major basins for 1984–2006. The authors believe that the resulting global water budget estimates can be used as a baseline dataset for large-scale diagnostic studies, for example, integrated assessment of basin water resources, trend analysis and attribution, and climate change studies. The global scale of the analysis presents significant challenges in carrying out the error analysis for each water budget variable. For some variables (e.g., evapotranspiration) the assumptions underpinning the error analysis lack supporting quantitative analysis and, thus, may not hold for specific locations. Nevertheless, the merging and water balance constraining technique can be applied to many problems.},

abstract = {Closing the terrestrial water budget is necessary to provide consistent estimates of budget components for understanding water resources and changes over time. Given the lack of in situ observations of budget components at anything but local scale, merging information from multiple data sources (e.g., in situ observation, satellite remote sensing, land surface model, and reanalysis) through data assimilation techniques that optimize the estimation of fluxes is a promising approach. Conditioned on the current limited data availability, a systematic method is developed to optimally combine multiple available data sources for precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and the total water storage change (TWSC) at 0.5 degrees spatial resolution globally and to obtain water budget closure (i.e., to enforce P - ET - R - TWSC = 0) through a constrained Kalman filter (CKF) data assimilation technique under the assumption that the deviation from the ensemble mean of all data sources for the same budget variable is used as a proxy of the uncertainty in individual water budget variables. The resulting long-term (1984-2010), monthly 0.5 degrees resolution global terrestrial water cycle Climate Data Record (CDR) data set is developed under the auspices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) program. This data set serves to bridge the gap between sparsely gauged regions and the regions with sufficient in situ observations in investigating the temporal and spatial variability in the terrestrial hydrology at multiple scales. The CDR created in this study is validated against in situ measurements like river discharge from the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and ET from FLUXNET. The data set is shown to be reliable and can serve the scientific community in understanding historical climate variability in water cycle fluxes and stores, benchmarking the current climate, and validating models.},

Mean annual rainfall (P), number of wet days (rainfall > 2 mm) (W) and annual rainfall accumulated over 3-hour time intervals (P<inf>3hr</inf>) were computed from TRMM 3B42 data for 1998-2009. Reduced rainfall was marked over the Rio Solimes/Amazon, along most Amazon tributaries and over the Balbina reservoir. In a smaller test area, a heuristic argument showed that P and W were reduced by 5% and 6.5% respectively. Allowing for TRMM 3B42 spatial resolution, the reduction may be locally greater. Analyses of diurnal rainfall patterns showed that rainfall is lowest over large rivers during the afternoon, when most rainfall is convective, but at night and early morning the opposite occurs, with increased rainfall over rivers, although this pattern is less marked. Rainfall patterns reported from studies of smaller Amazonian regions therefore exist more widely. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

We focus on the interannual, nonlinear modes of covariability between TWSAs and SSTs. By comparing the relative distributions of the leading modes, we identify teleconnections between TWSAs, Pacific and Atlantic SSTs at different time periods. Thus, the northern and northeastern regions of tropical South America are mainly influenced by Pacific SSTs, while the central and western Amazon regions are more influenced by Atlantic SSTs. The former regions are more sensitive to central Pacific SSTs than to eastern Pacific SSTs. A quasi-biennial mode explains the largest part (27%) of the residual, interannual cross covariance and is found both in the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation and in the Atlantic meridional mode. A trend-like mode explains the second largest part (24%) of the residual cross covariance and may be caused by the following: (1) the decadal variability in the North Pacific climate, as expressed by the negative trend in the Pacific decadal oscillation and by increased water storage in northern and northeastern South America, (2) the melting of Andean glaciers in Peru and Bolivia due to man-induced increase in land surface temperatures, and (3) the land use/cover changes after deforestation leading to increased runoff and groundwater recharge, expressed by increased water storage in southern Amazon regions.

We compared monthly rainfall, annual rainfall indices and their trends calculated using CHIRPS data and rain gauge observations with a point-to-pixel analysis. The use of daily CHIRPS data provided mean monthly rainfall similar to that obtained using data from the rain gauge stations, but CHIRPS data tend to underestimate the values for the rainiest months. The correlation was usually lower in the western Amazon, especially during its rainy season. The same underestimation was observed for extreme rainfall indices. CHIRPS product produces more similar results to rain gauge data for the indices PRCPTOT, nP, and R95pad, while strong underestimate the most extreme rainfall indices (R50mm, Rx1day, Rx5days). For the 45 stations and 15 rainfall indices analysed, 63 significant trends were detected using rain gauge data, of which only 13 were detected using CHIRPS product.

abstract = {A new dataset of historical monthly streamflow at the farthest downstream stations for the world's 925 largest ocean-reaching rivers has been created for community use. Available new gauge records are added to a network of gauges that covers ;80 3 10 6 km 2 or ;80% of global ocean-draining land areas and accounts for about 73% of global total runoff. For most of the large rivers, the record for 1948–2004 is fairly complete. Data gaps in the records are filled through linear regression using streamflow simulated by a land surface model [Community Land Model, version 3 (CLM3)] forced with observed precipitation and other atmospheric forcings that are significantly (and often strongly) correlated with the observed streamflow for most rivers. Compared with previous studies, the new dataset has improved homogeneity and enables more reliable assessments of decadal and long-term changes in continental freshwater discharge into the oceans. The model-simulated runoff ratio over drainage areas with and without gauge records is used to estimate the contribution from the areas not monitored by the gauges in deriving the total discharge into the global oceans. Results reveal large variations in yearly streamflow for most of the world's large rivers and for continental discharge, but only about one-third of the top 200 rivers (including the Congo, Mississippi, Yenisey, Paran{\'{a}}, Ganges, Columbia, Uruguay, and Niger) show statistically significant trends during 1948–2004, with the rivers having downward trends (45) outnumbering those with upward trends (19). The interannual variations are correlated with the El Ni{\~{n}} o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events for discharge into the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and global ocean as a whole. For ocean basins other than the Arctic, and for the global ocean as a whole, the discharge data show small or downward trends, which are statistically significant for the Pacific (29.4 km 3 yr 21). Precipitation is a major driver for the discharge trends and large interannual-to-decadal variations. Compari-sons with the CLM3 simulation suggest that direct human influence on annual streamflow is likely small compared with climatic forcing during 1948–2004 for most of the world's major rivers. For the Arctic drainage areas, upward trends in streamflow are not accompanied by increasing precipitation, especially over Siberia, based on available data, although recent surface warming and associated downward trends in snow cover and soil ice content over the northern high latitudes contribute to increased runoff in these regions. The results are qualitatively consistent with climate model projections but contradict an earlier report of increasing continental runoff during the recent decades based on limited records.},

abstract = {The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will measure water surface elevation, its spatial and temporal derivatives, and inundated area. These observations can be used to estimate river discharge at a global scale. SWOT will measure a given area on mid-latitude rivers two or three times per 22-day repeat cycle. In this paper, we suggest an interpolation-based method of estimating water height for times without SWOT observations (i.e., in between SWOT overpasses). A local space-time ordinary kriging (LSTOK) method is developed. Two sets of synthetic SWOT observations are generated by corrupting two different types of true river height with the instrument error. The true river heights are extracted from: 1) simulation of the LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model, and from 2) in situ gage measurements from five USGS gages. Both of these synthetic SWOT observations datasets are important for the following reasons. The model-based dataset provides a complete spatiotemporal picture of river height that is unavailable from in situ measurements, but neglects the effects of e.g. human management actions on river dynamics. On the other hand, the gage-based dataset samples only five locations on the river (1,050 km in length), but represents all effects of human management, tributaries, or other influences on river heights, which are not included in the model. The results are evaluated by a comparison with truth and simple linear interpolation estimates as a first-guess. The model-based experiment shows the LSTOK recovered the river heights with a mean spatial and temporal root mean square error (RMSE) of 11 cm and 12 cm, respectively; these accuracies show a 46% and 54% improvement compared to the RMSEs of the linear interpolation estimates. The gage-based experiment shows a temporal RMSE of 32 cm on average; the LSTOK estimates show a 23% improvement over the linear interpolation estimates. The degradation in performance of the LSTOK for the gage-based analysis as compared to the model-based analysis is apparently due to the effects of human management on river dynamics. Further work is needed to model the effects of human management, and to extend the analysis to consider river tributaries and the main stem of the river simultaneously. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Thus, overall the monthly temperature climate has not become more extreme.

Regionally, there is a lack of century-scale warming in the southeast U.S. annually and in parts of the central U.S. in the summer, characterized by lack of daytime warming while there has been nighttime warming. Compared to the earlier midcentury warm period, recent decades have been more (less) extreme in the summer (winter) in the west while Midwest summers have been less extreme.},

Only the after-real-time product incorporates gauge data at the present. The dataset covers the latitude band 50°N-S for the period from 1998 to the delayed present. Early validation results are as follows: the TMPA provides reasonable performance at monthly scales, although it is shown to have precipitation rate-dependent low bias due to lack of sensitivity to low precipitation rates over ocean in one of the input products [based on Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B)]. At finer scales the TMPA is successful at approximately reproducing the surface observation-based histogram of precipitation, as well as reasonably detecting large daily events. The TMPA, however, has lower skill in correctly specifying moderate and light event amounts on short time intervals, in common with other finescale estimators.

abstract = {This study analyzes the performance of the two soil hydrology schemes of the land surface model ORCHIDEE in estimating Amazonian hydrology and phenology for five major sub-basins (Xingu, Tapaj{\'{o}}s, Madeira, Solim{\~{o}}es and Negro), during the 29-year period 1980–2008. A simple 2-layer scheme with a bucket topped by an evaporative layer is compared to an 11-layer diffusion scheme. The soil schemes are coupled with a river routing module and a process model of plant physiology, phenology and carbon dynamics. The simulated water budget and vegetation functioning components are compared with several data sets at sub-basin scale. The use of the 11-layer soil diffusion scheme does not significantly change the Amazonian water budget simulation when compared to the 2- layer soil scheme (+3.1 and −3.0% in evapotranspiration and river discharge, respectively). However, the higher water-holding capacity of the soil and the physically based representation of runoff and drainage in the 11-layer soil diffusion scheme result in more dynamic soil water storage variation and improved simulation of the total terrestrial water storage when compared to GRACE satellite estimates. The greater soil water storage within the 11-layer scheme also results in increased dry-season evapotranspiration (+0.5mmd−1, +17 %) and improves river discharge simulation in the southeastern sub-basins such as the Xingu. Evapotranspiration over this sub-basin is sustained during the whole dry season with the 11-layer soil diffusion scheme, whereas the 2-layer scheme limits it after only 2 dry months. Lower plant drought stress simulated by the 11-layer soil diffusion scheme leads to better simulation of the seasonal cycle of photosynthesis (GPP) when compared to a GPP data-driven model based on eddy covariance and satellite greenness measurements. A dry-season length between 4 and 7 months over the entire Amazon Basin is found to be critical in distinguishing differences in hydrological feedbacks between the soil and the vegetation cover simulated by the two soil schemes. On average, the multilayer soil diffusion scheme provides little improvement in simulated hydrology over the wet tropical Amazonian sub-basins, but a more significant improvement is found over the drier sub-basins. The use of a multilayer soil diffusion scheme might become critical for assessments of future hydrological changes, especially in southern regions of the Amazon Basin where longer dry seasons and more severe droughts are expected in the next century.},

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provided monthly global estimates of the vertically integrated terrestrial water storage with about 300–400-km horizontal resolution between 2002 and 2017. Since 2009, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission observes global L-band brightness temperatures, which are sensitive to near-surface soil moisture, with a revisit time of 1–3 days at a nominal 43-km spatial resolution. This work investigates if the multi-sensor assimilation of these observations into the Catchment land surface model can improve the estimation of 0–5 cm “surface” soil moisture, 0–100 cm “rootzone” soil moisture, and shallow (unconfined) groundwater levels. Single-sensor GRACE or SMOS assimilation and multi-sensor GRACE+SMOS assimilation experiments were performed over the continental U.S. for 6 years (July 2010–June 2016). GRACE data assimilation mostly improves estimates of shallow groundwater, whereas SMOS data assimilation mainly improves estimates of surface soil moisture. The benefits introduced by the single-sensor assimilation are merged in the multi-sensor assimilation experiment, suggesting that better and more consistent soil moisture and groundwater estimates can be achieved when multiple observation types are assimilated. Interestingly, in the multi-sensor GRACE+SMOS experiment, the water storage increments introduced by the GRACE analysis and the SMOS analysis are anti-correlated. That is, when the GRACE assimilation increments remove water from the overall profile storage, the SMOS assimilation increments add water to it, and vice versa. This anti-correlation could be caused by the SMOS analysis trying to undo the increments from the GRACE analysis.},

abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Land surface models (LSMs) are widely used to study the continental part of the water cycle. However, even though their accuracy is increasing, inherent model uncertainties can not be avoided. In the meantime, remotely sensed observations of the continental water cycle variables such as soil moisture, lakes and river elevations are more frequent and accurate. Therefore, those two different types of information can be combined, using data assimilation techniques to reduce a model's uncertainties in its state variables or/and in its input parameters. The objective of this study is to present a data assimilation platform that assimilates into the large-scale ISBA-CTRIP LSM a punctual river discharge product, derived from ENVISAT nadir altimeter water elevation measurements and rating curves, over the whole Amazon basin. To deal with the scale difference between the model and the observation, the study also presents an initial development for a localization treatment that allows one to limit the impact of observations to areas close to the observation and in the same hydrological network. This assimilation platform is based on the ensemble Kalman filter and can correct either the CTRIP river water storage or the discharge. Root mean square error (RMSE) compared to gauge discharges is globally reduced until 21<span class="thinspace"></span>% and at {\'{O}}bidos, near the outlet, RMSE is reduced by up to 52<span class="thinspace"></span>% compared to ENVISAT-based discharge. Finally, it is shown that localization improves results along the main tributaries.</p>},

abstract = {The performance of hydrological and hydrometeorological water-balance-based methods to estimate monthly runoff is analyzed. Such an analysis also allows for the examination of the closure of water budgets at different spatial (continental and catchment) and temporal (monthly, seasonal, and annual) scales. For this analysis, different combinations of gridded observations [Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), Climate Prediction Center (CPC), Climatic Research Unit (CRU), and University of Delaware (DEL)], atmospheric reanalysis models [Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)], partially model-based datasets [Global Land Surface Evaporation: The Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16), and FLUXNET Multi-Tree Ensemble (FLUXNET MTE)], and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite-derived water storage changes are employed. The derived ensemble of hydrological and hydrometeoro-logical budget–based runoff estimates, together with results from different land surface hydrological models [Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and the land-only version of MERRA (MERRA-Land)] and a simple predictor based on the precipitation–runoff ratio, is compared with observed monthly in situ runoff for 96 catchments of different sizes and climatic conditions worldwide. Despite significant shortcomings of the budget-based methods over many catchments, the evaluation allows for the demarcation of areas with consistently reasonable runoff es-timates. Good agreement was particularly observed when runoff followed a dominant annual cycle like the Amazon. This holds true also for catchments with an area far below the spatial resolution of GRACE, like the Rhine. Over catchments with low or nearly constant runoff, the budget-based approaches do not provide realistic runoff estimates because of significant biases in the input datasets. In general, no specific data combination could be identified that consistently performed over all catchments. Thus, the performance over a specific single catchment cannot be ex-trapolated to other regions. Only in few cases do specific dataset combinations provide reasonable water budget closure; in most cases, significant imbalances remain for all the applied datasets.},

abstract = {The large-scale observations of terrestrial water storage from GRACE satellites over the Amazon are analyzed with land surface model (LSM) outputs of runoff and soil moisture. A simple yet effective runoff routing method based on a continuity equation is implemented to model horizontal transport of surface water within the Amazon basin. The GRACE observations are analyzed separately for soil moisture and surface water storages (generated from runoff), relying on their distinct spatial patterns, being disperse for soil moisture and localized for surface water. Various effective velocities for storage transport are tested against the GRACE observations. When the model runoff is routed with an uniform velocity of 30 cm/s, the annual variation of the resulting surface water storage is generally found to be larger than the satellite measurements and ground gauge data by a factor of 1.5 or higher. The peak annual anomaly of surface water storage is observed around the midstream of the Amazon main stem. However, the runoff routing simulations present the peak amplitude consistently around the delta (downstream), unless the increasing velocity in a downstream region is used. As complements to the ground gauge data, the satellite observations provide unique spatial information of water cycle parameters. Our analysis indicates possible shortcomings in the certain LSM mass transport scheme between atmosphere and land surface, particularly the production of too large seasonal variations in runoff (and maybe too little variations in evapotranspiration), and the dynamic characteristics of surface water transport within the Amazon basins.

Remote sensing-based variables including soil moisture (from AMSR-E), surface heat fluxes (from MODIS) and precipitation rates (from TRMM) are combined with North American Regional Reanalysis derived atmospheric components to examine the degree of hydrological consistency throughout these diverse and independent hydrologic data sets. The study focuses on the influence of the North American Monsoon System (NAMS) over the southwestern United States, and is timed to coincide with the SMEX04 North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME). The study is focused over the Arizona portion of the NAME domain to assist in better characterizing the hydrometeorological processes occurring across Arizona during the summer monsoon period. Results demonstrate that this multi-sensor approach, in combination with available atmospheric observations, can be used to obtain a comprehensive and hydrometeorologically consistent characterization of the land surface water cycle, leading to an improved understanding of water and energy cycles within the NAME region and providing a novel framework for future remote observation and analysis of the coupled land surface–atmosphere system.},

abstract = {The Andes is the longest cordillera in the world and extends from northern South America to the southern extreme of the continent (from 11°N to 53°S). The Andes runs through seven countries and is characterized by a wide variety of ecosystems strongly related to the contrasting climate over its eastern and western sides, as well as along its latitudinal extension. This region faces very high potential impacts of climate change, which could affect food and water security for about 90 million people. In addition, climate change represents an important threat on biodiversity, particularly in the tropical Andes, which is the most biodiverse region on Earth. From a scientific and societal view, the Andes exhibits specific challenges because of its unique landscape and the fragile equilibrium between the growing population and its environment. In this manuscript, we provide an updated review of the most relevant scientific literature regarding the hydroclimate of the Andes with an integrated view of the entire Andes range. This review paper is presented in two parts. Part I is dedicated to summarize the scientific knowledge about the main climatic features of the Andes, with emphasis on mean large-scale atmospheric circulation, the Andes-Amazon hydroclimate interconnections and the most distinctive diurnal and annual cycles of precipitation. Part II, which is also included in the research topic “Connecting Mountain Hydroclimate Through the American Cordilleras,” focuses on the hydroclimate variability of the Andes at the sub-continental scale, including the effects of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation.},

Monthly average water budget analyses were made for 13,332 stations over the globe and, then spatially interpolated to a regular grid at 1° by 1° latitude‐longitude intervals. From the monthly fields on a 4° by 5° subset of the 1° by 1° grid, the annual mean and standard deviation as well as the first and second annual harmonics were extracted and are displayed on global maps. Of the three fields, soil moisture has the largest space‐time variation; snow‐cover the smallest variation; and evapotranspiration an intermediate level of variation.

abstract = {<p>Wetlands are important players in the Earth climate system because of their effect on ecosystems, river discharge, water quality, and through their feedback effects on atmosphere by increasing methane emission and evapotranspiration. Many datasets have been developed for open water and wetland mapping, based on three main methods: (i) compiling national/regional wetland maps; (ii) identifying inundated areas by satellite imagery; (iii) delineating wetlands as areas with shallow water table depths. There is a massive disagreement, however, between the resulting wetland extent estimates (from 3 to 21&thinsp;% of the land surface area). To reconcile these differences, we propose composite wetland (CW) maps consisting of two classes of wetlands: (1) regularly flooded wetlands (RFWs) which are obtained by overlapping selected open-water and inundation datasets, and cover 9.7&thinsp;% of the land surface area; (2) scattered groundwater wetlands (SGWs), derived either from direct groundwater modelling or simplified modelling based on the topographic index (TI), using several variants. In this framework, wetlands are defined as zones that are either inundated or where the groundwater is sufficiently close to the surface to maintain near saturated soil surface. By combining RFW and different SGW maps, seven CW maps are generated, which correspond to contemporary potential wetlands, i.e. the areas that would turn into actual wetlands under the present climate assuming no human influence. They are produced at the 15 arc-sec resolution (almost 500&thinsp;m at the Equator) using geographic information system (GIS) tools. Two CW maps, showing the best overall match with the available evaluation datasets, are eventually selected. Wetlands in these maps respectively cover 21.1 and 21.6&thinsp;% of the global land area, which is in the high end of the literature range, along with recent estimates also recognizing the contribution of groundwater-driven wetlands. The two proposed composite maps agree massively about six major wetland hotspots, which include 75&thinsp;% of the global wetlands, and concentrate in the boreal, tropical, and coastal zones. The high wetland density in the tropics is brought by the SGWs, which allows detecting wetlands under dense canopy and cloud cover. Another major feature of the two CW maps, brought by the SGWs and the high resolution of the maps, is the identification of many small and scattered wetlands, which cover less than 5&thinsp;% of the land area, but are very important for hydrological and ecological functioning in temperate to arid areas. By distinguishing the RFWs and SGWs globally based on uniform principles, we eventually propose a simple wetland classification focused on hydrologic functioning, believed to be very useful for large-scale land surface modelling.</p>},

abstract = {Climate change and its effects on the hydrologic regime of the Amazon basin can impact biogeochemical processes, transportation, flood vulnerability, fisheries and hydropower generation. We examined projections of climate change on discharge and inundation extent in the Amazon basin using the regional hydrological model MGB-IPH with 1-dimensional river hydraulic and water storage simulation in floodplains. Future projections (2070–2099) were obtained from five GCMs from IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report CMIP5. Climate projections have uncertainty and results from different climate models did not agree in total Amazon flooded area or discharge anomalies along the main stem river. Overall, model runs agree better with wetter (drier) conditions over western (eastern) Amazon. Results indicate that increased mean and maximum river discharge for large rivers draining the Andes in the northwest contributes to increased mean and maximum discharge and inundation extent over Peruvian floodplains and Solim{\~{o}}es River (annual mean-max: +9 % - +18.3 %) in western Amazonia. Decreased river discharges (mostly dry season) are projected for eastern basins, and decreased inundation extent at low water (annual min) in the central (−15.9 %) and lower Amazon (−4.4 %).},

abstract = {The highly intermittent and sparse nature of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) river observations in both space and time poses a major challenge to users for most applications. While interpolation/assimilation efforts exist to assemble discrete SWOT river observations into a spatially complete and temporally continuous record, the efficacy of such efforts is severely compromised by large observation gaps. In this study, we introduced spatiotemporal error correlations in runoff fields into the Inverse Streamflow Routing (ISR) model to improve the gap-filling capability for creating continuous daily discharge. This enhanced ISR model was first investigated in the Ohio River basin, which showed very significant improvements with better reproduced spatial and temporal dynamics of the runoff fields and the discharge time series. Results using 25 validation gauges showed a more concentrated Kling-Gupta Efficiency distribution, where the median was improved from 0.494 to 0.750. The enhanced ISR model was further tested over 16 representative global river basins to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The best fitted e-fold correlation length and time leading to the greatest improvements varied largely among the 16 basins. While all basins benefitted from the spatiotemporal correlations in the SWOT gap-filling, basins suffering from poorer initial guess and fewer SWOT observations, such as the Dnieper, Kolyma and Murray basins, showed larger performance gains than others. Although the experiments were idealized and did not reflect all potential errors that may be present in a real-world application, we demonstrate that the utility of SWOT river products and their value in hydrologic sciences may be boosted by expanding a local/intermittent observation platform into a far-reaching source of hydrologic information through both river hydrodynamics in channel networks and spatiotemporal coherence of runoff errors.},

Recent studies indicate that deep learning achieves best performance in image segmentation tasks. Aiming at boosting the accuracy of cloud detection for multispectral imagery, especially for those that contain only visible and near infrared bands, in this paper, we proposed a deep learning based cloud detection method termed MSCN (multi-scale cloud net), which segments cloud by fusing multi-scale convolutional features. MSCN was trained on a global cloud cover validation collection, and was tested in more than ten types of optical images with different resolution. Experiment results show that MSCN has obvious advantages over the traditional multi-feature combined cloud detection method in accuracy, especially when in snow and other areas covered by bright non-cloud objects. Besides, MSCN produced more detailed cloud masks than the compared deep cloud detection convolution network. The effectiveness of MSCN make it promising for practical application in multiple kinds of optical imagery.</p>},

abstract = {Tropical forests play an important role as a reservoir of carbon and biodiversity, specifically forests in the Brazilian Amazon. However, the last decades have been marked by important changes in the Amazon, particularly those associated with climatic extremes. Quantifying the variability of rainfall patterns, hence, is essential for understanding changes and impacts of climate upon this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to analyse spatiotemporal trends in rainfall along the Brazilian Legal Amazon between 1998 and 2015. For this purpose, rainfall data derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite (TRMM) and nonparametric statistical methods, such as Mann-Kendall and Sen's Slope, were used. Through this approach, some patterns were identified. No evidence of significant rainfall trends (p ≤ 0.05) for annual or monthly (except for September, which showed a significant negative trend) averages was found. However, significant monthly negative rainfall anomalies were found in 1998, 2005, 2010, and 2015, and positive in 1999, 2000, 2004, 2009, and 2013. The annual pixel-by-pixel analysis showed that 92.3% of the Brazilian Amazon had no rainfall trend during the period analysed, 4.2% had significant negative trends (p ≤ 0.05), and another 3.5% had significant positive trends (p ≤ 0.05). Despite no clear temporal rainfall trends for most of the Amazon had negative trends for September, corresponding to the peak of dry season in the majority of the region, and negative rainfall anomalies found in 22% of the years analysed, which indicate that water-dependent ecological processes may be negatively affected. Moreover, these processes may be under increased risk of disruption resulting from other drought-related events, such as wildfires, which are expect to be intensified by rainfall reduction during the Amazonian dry season.},

To provide some global background for these regional experiments, the authors describe vertically integrated global and regional water and energy budgets from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)–U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Reanalysis II (NCEPRII). It is shown that maintaining the NCEPRII close to observations requires some nudging to the short-range model forecast, and this nudging is an important component of analysis budgets. Still, to first order one can discern important hydroclimatological mechanisms in the reanalysis. For example, during summer, atmospheric water vapor, precipitation, evaporation, and surface and atmospheric radiative heating all increase, while the dry static energy convergence decreases almost everywhere over the land region...},

abstract = {Given their strong interaction with both climate and the carbon cycle, wetlands and surface waters need to be parameterized in global general circulation models. For this purpose, a new simple flooding river scheme is proposed and evaluated over South America. The flood dynamics is described through the coupling between the ISBA land surface model and the TRIP river routing model including a prognostic flood reservoir. This reservoir fills when the river height exceeds a critical value and vice versa. The reservoir interacts with the soil hydrology through infiltration and with the overlying atmosphere through precipitation interception and free water surface evaporation. The model is tested in off-line mode using the 10-year ISLSCP-2 atmospheric forcing. The evaluation is made against satellite-derived inundation estimates as well as in situ river discharge observations. Besides a basin-scale increase in annual surface evaporation, the results show improved monthly discharges over the Amazon and Parana rivers, as well as a reasonable agreement between the simulated flooded areas and satellite-derived inundation estimates.},

abstract = {This report reviews the current value of satellite data assimilation activities at ECMWF and outlines the strategy for future development. The Centre makes extensive use of satellite observations in atmospheric, ocean and land surface analyses, and also for atmospheric composition both in the Integrated Forecasting System and in MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate). Many satellite data types such as the sounders are very well established and form the backbone of the observing system. It is essential for any state of the art Numerical Weather Prediction system to get the sounder assimilation right, and properly maintain it. Whilst recognising the importance of what we might call conventional satellite data this report will focus on new developments and areas that are increasingly important. ECMWF contribute very significantly to the future development of the global observing system both through assessing the potential impact of new data and by being pioneering in the use of innovative satellite data, including data from research satellites such as those in the A-train and ESA's Earth Explorer missions. As NWP systems improve it is becoming harder to acquire observations good enough to improve further the accuracy of the forecast. It is important to make well informed choices about which new observations investment should be made and then to do the hard work to make sure we can exploit these observations. Through better observations, advances in data assimilation techniques and in the way observations are handled satellite data is continuing to make a major contribution to improve medium range weather forecast skill.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporally continuous global river discharge estimates across the full spectrum of stream orders are vital to a range of hydrologic applications, yet they remain poorly constrained. Here we present a carefully designed modeling effort (Variable Infiltration Capacity land surface model and Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge river routing model) to estimate global river discharge at very high resolutions. The precipitation forcing is from a recently published 0.1° global product that optimally merged gauge-, reanalysis-, and satellite-based data. To constrain runoff simulations, we use a set of machine learning-derived, global runoff characteristics maps (i.e., runoff at various exceedance probability percentiles) for grid-by-grid model calibration and bias correction. To support spaceborne discharge studies, the river flowlines are defined at their true geometry and location as much as possible—approximately 2.94 million vector flowlines (median length 6.8 km) and unit catchments are derived from a high-accuracy global digital elevation model at 3-arcsec resolution ($\sim$90 m), which serves as the underlying hydrography for river routing. Our 35-year daily and monthly model simulations are evaluated against over 14,000 gauges globally. Among them, 35% (64%) have a percentage bias within ±20% (±50%), and 29% (62%) have a monthly Kling-Gupta Efficiency ≥0.6 (0.2), showing data robustness at the scale the model is assessed. This reconstructed discharge record can be used as a priori information for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission's discharge product, thus named “Global Reach-level A priori Discharge Estimates for Surface Water and Ocean Topography”. It can also be used in other hydrologic applications requiring spatially explicit estimates of global river flows.},

The method presented here is based on retrieval principals similar to GIEMS but with an updated estimation of microwave emissivity in order to be less dependent on ancillary data and with some changes to the final surface water estimation to correct a known overestimation over low vegetation areas. The new methodology, GIEMS-2, provides monthly estimates of surface water extent, including open water, wetlands, or rice paddies, and it has been applied to the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder intercalibrated observations to produce a global data record of surface water extent from 1992 to 2015, on an equal area grid of 0.25° × 0.25° at the equator (∼25 km). The time series have been thoroughly evaluated: they are seamless and do not show any obvious artifact related to changes in satellite instrumentation over the ∼25 years. Comparisons with precipitation estimates show good agreement, displaying expected patterns related to surface conditions and precipitation regimes. The temporal variability of basin-averaged estimates has also been compared with altimeter river height, showing a reasonable agreement. Production will be continued up to current time as soon as the observations become available, with efforts to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of the estimates currently underway.},

abstract = {The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) is an ultra-spectral satellite sensor with 8461 spectral channels. IASI spectra contain high information content on atmospheric, cloud, and surface properties. The instrument presents a challenge for using thousands of spectral channels in a physical retrieval system or in a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data assimilation system. In this paper we describe a method of simultaneously retrieving atmospheric temperature, moisture, and cloud properties using all available IASI channels without sacrificing computational speed. The essence of the method is to convert the IASI channel radiance spectra into super-channels by an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) transformation. Studies show that about 100 super-channels are adequate to capture the information content of the radiance spectra. A Principal Component-based Radiative Transfer Model (PCRTM) is used to calculate both the super-channel magnitudes and derivatives with respect to atmospheric profiles and other properties. A physical retrieval algorithm then performs an inversion of atmospheric, cloud, and surface properties in the super channel domain directly therefore both reducing the computational need and preserving the information content of the IASI measurements. While no large-scale validation has been performed on any retrieval methodology presented in this paper, comparisons of the retrieved atmospheric profiles, sea surface temperatures, and surface emissivities with co-located ground- and aircraft-based measurements over four days in Spring 2007 over the South-Central United States indicate excellent agreement.},

@article{Trenberth2011,
abstract = {There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: it never rains but it pours! This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid- to high latitudes: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. more bang for the buck, atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Ni o a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.},

abstract = {In this paper, a hydrologic/hydrodynamic modeling of the Amazon River basin is presented using the MGB-IPH model with a validation using remotely sensed observations. Moreover, the sources of model errors by means of the validation and sensitivity tests are investigated, and the physical functioning of the Amazon basin is also explored. The MGB-IPH is a physically based model resolving all land hydrological processes and here using a full 1-D river hydrodynamic module with a simple floodplain storage model. River-floodplain geometry parameters were extracted from the SRTM digital elevation model, and the model was forced using satellite-derived rainfall from TRMM3B42. Model results agree with observed in situ daily river discharges and water levels and with three complementary satellite-based products: (1) water levels derived from ENVISAT altimetry data; (2) a global data set of monthly inundation extent; and (3) monthly terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experimental mission. However, the model is sensitive to precipitation forcing and river-floodplain parameters. Most of the errors occur in westerly regions, possibly due to the poor quality of TRMM 3B42 rainfall data set in these mountainous and/or poorly monitored areas. In addition, uncertainty in river-floodplain geometry causes errors in simulated water levels and inundation extent, suggesting the need for improvement of parameter estimation methods. Finally, analyses of Amazon hydrological processes demonstrate that surface waters govern most of the Amazon TWS changes (56%), followed by soil water (27%) and ground water (8%). Moreover, floodplains play a major role in stream flow routing, although backwater effects are also important to delay and attenuate flood waves. {\textcopyright}2013. American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (TESSEL) is used operationally in the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) for describing the evolution of soil, vegetation, and snow over the continents at diverse spatial resolutions. A revised land surface hydrology (H-TESSEL) is introduced in the ECMWF operational model to address shortcomings of the land surface scheme, specifically the lack of surface runoff and the choice of a global uniform soil texture. New infiltration and runoff schemes are introduced with a dependency on the soil texture and standard deviation of orography. A set of experiments in stand-alone mode is used to assess the improved prediction of soil moisture at the local scale against field site observations. Comparison with basin-scale water balance (BSWB) and Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) datasets indicates a consistently larger dynamical range of land water mass over large continental areas and an improved prediction of river runoff, while the effect on atmospheric fluxes is fairly small. Finally, the ECMWF data assimilation and prediction systems are used to verify the effect on surface and near-surface quantities in the atmospheric-coupled mode. A midlatitude error reduction is seen both in soil moisture and in 2-m temperature. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {A quantification of groundwater fluxes in the hydrologic cycle for large river basins and on a global scale is reported in this paper. Groundwater contributions to river runoff (i.e. baseflow), direct submarine groundwater discharge to the ocean floor, and salt throughput to oceans and seas are analyzed. The baseflow/precipitation and baseflow/river runoff ratios are found to be approximately 10% and 30% on a world-wide basis, showing great geographical variability across the major continents of the Earth. Direct groundwater discharge to the ocean floor is only 6% of the total water influx to oceans and seas, yet, it contributes a salt load to oceans and seas that is approximately 50% of the salt loading by rivers. Factors and uncertainties germane to global groundwater balancing, recent anthropogenic modifications of groundwater contributions to runoff, and the likely role of potential global warming in groundwater circulation are discussed. Over the last 300 years baseflow contribution to river runoff has slightly increased, whereas the river runoff has declined as a result of anthropogenic modifications to the natural environment. Assuming a 10% increase in global annual precipitation from potential greenhouse warming, the associated increases in baseflow contribution to river runoff and direct groundwater discharge to oceans would amount to 1200 km3 year-1 and 260 km3 year-1, respectively. The additional salt load to oceans and seas by direct groundwater flow is estimated at 140 000 000 t year-1. Salinity of oceans and seas could rise if their water volumes do not increase enough to offset the larger salt load. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

TMPA is available both after and in real time, based on calibration by the TRMM Combined Instrument and TRMM Microwave Imager precipitation products, respectively. Only the after-real-time product incorporates gauge data at the present. The dataset covers the latitude band 50°N-S for the period from 1998 to the delayed present. Early validation results are as follows: the TMPA provides reasonable performance at monthly scales, although it is shown to have precipitation rate-dependent low bias due to lack of sensitivity to low precipitation rates over ocean in one of the input products [based on Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B)]. At finer scales the TMPA is successful at approximately reproducing the surface observation-based histogram of precipitation, as well as reasonably detecting large daily events. The TMPA, however, has lower skill in correctly specifying moderate and light event amounts on short time intervals, in common with other finescale estimators. Examples are provided of a flood event and diurnal cycle determination. {\textcopyright}2007 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This study is a geochemical investigation of the Andean and Foreland basins of the Amazon River at high spatial and time resolution, carried out within the framework of the HYBAM research program (Hydro-geodynamics of the Amazon Basin). Monthly sampling was carried out at 27 gauging stations located in the upper tributaries of the Amazon Basin (from north to south: the Napo, Mara{\~{n}}on, Ucayali, Madre de Dios-Beni and Mamore Rivers). The aim of this paper is to estimate the present-day chemical weathering rate (CWR), as well as the flux of CO2 consumption from total and silicate weathering in the Andes and Foreland Amazon basins, and to discuss their distribution as a function of geomorphic and structural parameters. Based on the forward method, the Napo and other Ecuadorian basins present high silicate weathering rates in comparison with the other basins. We confirm that the Mara{\~{n}}on and Ucayali Rivers control the Amazon hydrochemistry due to the presence of salt rocks and carbonates in these basins. The Madre de Dios, Beni and Mamore basins do not contribute much to the Amazon dissolved load. This north to south CWR gradient can be explained by the combination of decreasing weatherable lithology surface and decreasing runoff rates from the north to the south. The foreland part of the basins (or Mountain-Lowland transition) accounts for nearly the same proportion of the Amazon silicate chemical weathering and carbonate chemical weathering fluxes as the Andean part. This result demonstrates the importance of the sediment accumulation areas in the Amazon Basin weathering budget and can be explained by the occurrence of a higher temperature, the deposition of fresh sediments from Andean erosion and a higher sediment residence time than in the upper part of the basin. With a total CO2 consumption rate of 744.103moleskm-2year-1 and a silicate CO2 consumption rate of 300.103moleskm-2year-1, the Upper Amazon River (Andes+Foreland part) is the most intense part of the Amazon Basin in terms of atmospheric CO2 consumption by weathering processes. It is an important CO2 sink by weathering processes but accounts for only somewhat more than half of the CO2 consumption by silicate weathering of the Amazon Basin. This result points out the importance of the Lowland part of the basin in the inorganic C silicate budget. The Upper Amazon accounts for 2-4% of the world's silicate CO2 consumption, which is the same proportion as for the southern and southern-east Himalaya and Tibetan plateau. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Observations of terrestrial water storage (TWS) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission have a coarse resolution in time (monthly) and space (roughly 150,000 km2 at midlatitudes) and vertically integrate all water storage components over land, including soil moisture and groundwater. Data assimilation can be used to horizontally downscale and vertically partition GRACE-TWS observations. This work proposes a variant of existing ensemble-based GRACE-TWS data assimilation schemes. The new algorithm differs in how the analysis increments are computed and applied. Existing schemes correlate the uncertainty in the modeled monthly TWS estimates with errors in the soil moisture profile state variables at a single instant in the month and then apply the increment either at the end of the month or gradually throughout the month. The proposed new scheme first computes increments for each day of the month and then applies the average of those increments at the beginning of the month. The new scheme therefore better reflects submonthly variations in TWS errors. The new and existing schemes are investigated here using gridded GRACE-TWS observations. The assimilation results are validated at the monthly time scale, using in situ measurements of groundwater depth and soil moisture across the U.S. The new assimilation scheme yields improved (although not in a statistically significant sense) skill metrics for groundwater compared to the open-loop (no assimilation) simulations and compared to the existing assimilation schemes. A smaller impact is seen for surface and root-zone soil moisture, which have a shorter memory and receive smaller increments from TWS assimilation than groundwater. These results motivate future efforts to combine GRACE-TWS observations with observations that are more sensitive to surface soil moisture, such as L-band brightness temperature observations from Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) or Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP). Finally, we demonstrate that the scaling parameters that are applied to the GRACE observations prior to assimilation should be consistent with the land surface model that is used within the assimilation system.},

The adjustment is based on the spatially variable ratio of rainrate estimates from coincident microwave and infrared data, which is then applied to the full geo-IR data set. The resulting "microwave-adjusted geo-IR rain estimate' has the (usually low) bias of the microwave estimates, together with the smoothness and temporal coverage of the geo-IR data. Here, the microwave estimates from the Goddard Scattering Algorithm (GSCAT) are used to adjust the geo-IR estimates from the Geosynchronous Precipitation Index (GPI) to form the Adjusted GPI (AGPI) technique. -from Authors},

abstract = {Satellite-based precipitation products are promising data sources for the hydrometeorological community. However, many of these products lack quantitative estimates of their uncertainty. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation study of the state-of-the-art satellite-based precipitation product: Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) research product (TRMM 3B42) in the middle and upper reaches of Heihe River Basin. The study area locates in arid and semiarid regions in the northwest of China. Both version 6 (V6) and the newly released version 7 (V7) TRMM 3B42 research products are evaluated through statistical analysis and hydrological modeling in this study. We find that the performance of daily TMPA products is climatology-dependent. For the study basin, TMPA products generally perform better in wetter than in drier climatology conditions. High False Alarming Ratio (FAR) and positive bias occur in drier areas, whereas TMPA products display negative bias in wetter regions. TMPA products perform worse in winter when snowfall occurs than in nonsnow seasons. The new V7 TMPA products perform better than V6 on both daily and monthly scales. Hydrological modeling results show that TMPA products are promising in streamflow simulation at ungauged basins in arid and semiarid regions, especially the new V7 whose integrated performance is comparable with that of gauge-based precipitation estimate. When model parameters' sensitivity in forcing precipitation is considered by model recalibration, performances of both two versions of TMPA products are improved, especially for the peak flow simulation in summer. This study can serve as a reference of uncertainty estimates of the TMPA research time precipitation products in hydrometeorological applications at a watershed scale.},

To provide a variety of clustering solutions, the data sets were analyzed by four hierarchical clustering methods. External criterion measures indicated excellent recovery of the true cluster structure by the methods at the correct hierarchy level. Thus, the clustering present in the data was quite strong. The simulation results for the stopping rules revealed a wide range in their ability to determine the correct number of clusters in the data. Several procedures worked fairly well, whereas others performed rather poorly. Thus, the latter group of rules would appear to have little validity, particularly for data sets containing distinct clusters. Applied researchers are urged to select one or more of the better criteria. However, users are cautioned that the performance of some of the criteria may be data dependent.},

abstract = {Information on the vertical structure of rain, especially near the surface is important for accurate quantitative precipitation estimation from weather and space-borne radars. In the present study, the rainfall characteristics, from a vertically pointed profile Radar in the Mantaro basin (Huancayo, Peru) are observed. In summary, diurnal variation of near-surface rainfall and bright band height, average vertical profiles of the drop size distribution (DSD), rain rate, radar reflectivity (Ze) and liquid water content (LWC) are investigated to derive the rainfall characteristics. Diurnal variation of rain rate and bright band height show the bimodal distribution, where frequent and higher rain rate occurred during the afternoon and nighttime, and more than 70% bright band height found between 4.3-4.7 km. The average vertical profiles of Ze show the opposite characteristics above and below the melting level (ML) and depend on the near-surface rain rate. For example, the average Ze profiles have a negative gradient above the ML, whereas below, the ML, the gradient depends on the near-surface rain rate. The rain rate and LWC show the opposite behavior, and both consist of a positive (negative) gradient below (above) the ML. The vertical growth of DSD parameters depend on the near-surface rain rate, and a higher concentration of large-sized of droplets are observed for higher near surface rain rate, however, the dominant modes of droplets are <1 mm throughout the vertical column. However, the most significant variation in DSD growth is observed for near-surface rain rate ≥20 mm/h. These findings suggest using different retrieval techniques for near surface rain estimation than the rest of the vertical profile and high rain rate events. The improved understanding of the tropical Andes precipitation would be very important for assessing climate variability and to forecast the precipitation using the numerical models.},

abstract = {A fundamental question connecting terrestrial ecology and global climate change is the sensitivity of key terrestrial biomes to climatic variability and change. The Amazon region is such a key biome: it contains unparalleled biological diversity, a globally significant store of organic carbon, and it is a potent engine driving global cycles of water and energy. The importance of understanding how land surface dynamics of the Amazon region respond to climatic variability and change is widely appreciated, but despite significant recent advances, large gaps in our understanding remain. Understanding of energy and carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere can be improved through direct observations and experiments, as well as through modeling activities. Land surface/ecosystem models have become important tools for extrapolating local observations and understanding to much larger terrestrial regions. They are also valuable tools to test hypothesis on ecosystem functioning. Funded by NASA under the auspices of the LBA (the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia), the LBA Data Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-DMIP) uses a comprehensive data set from an observational network of flux towers across the Amazon, and an ecosystem modeling community engaged in ongoing studies using a suite of different land surface and terrestrial ecosystem models to understand Amazon forest function.

This model is focused on the efficient description of the drainage system in its essential parts: hillslopes and channel networks are addressed with two kinematic scales, which determine the base of the geomorphologic response of the basin. The geomorphologic module is coupled with a simple distributed representation of soil infiltration properties, while the rainfall event is schematized with its variability in time and space. The runoff volume is routed with a time variant TUH (T-hour Unit Hydrograph) technique, which takes into account the runoff production variability. Parameters calibration and validation have been carried out using different intense rainfall events in different size basins. This robust and parsimonious model is able to predict consistently the main features of the hydrograph; the observed parameter invariance allows the reliable utilization for flood forecasting, especially in regions where many small non-gauged basins are present.},

abstract = {Satellite retrievals of surface evaporation and precipitation from the Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite Data (HOAPS-3) dataset are used to document the distribution of evaporation, precipitation, and freshwater flux over the Mediterranean and Black Seas. An analysis is provided of the major scales of temporal and spatial variability of the freshwater budget and the atmospheric processes responsible for the water flux changes. The satellite evaporation fluxes are compared with fields from three different reanalysis datasets 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), ERA-Interim, and NCEP. The results show a water deficit in the Mediterranean region that averages to about 2.4 mm day1 but with a significant eastwest asymmetry ranging from 3.5 mm day1 in the eastern part to about 1.1 mm day1 in the western part of the basin. The zonal asymmetry in the water deficit is driven by evaporation differences that are in turn determined by variability in the airsea humidity difference in the different parts of the Mediterranean basin. The Black Sea freshwater deficit is 0.5 mm day1, with maxima off the northern coast (0.9 mm day1) that are attributed to both evaporation maxima and precipitation minima there. The trend analysis of the freshwater budget shows that the freshwater deficit increases in the 19882005 period. The prominent increase in the eastern part of the basin is present in the satellite and all three reanalysis datasets. The water deficit is due to increases in evaporation driven by increasing sea surface temperature, while precipitation does not show any consistent trends in the period. Similarly, in the Black Sea, trends in the freshwater deficit are mainly due to evaporation, although year-to-year variability is due to precipitation patterns.},

In this study, surface water storage (SWS) variations are estimated at monthly time-scale over 15 years (1993–2007) using a hypsographic approach based on the combination of topographic information from Advance Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP)-based Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEM) and the Global Inundation Extent Multi-Satellite (GIEMS) product in the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin. The monthly variations of the surface water storage are in good accordance with precipitation from Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), river discharges at the outlet of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, and terrestrial water storage (TWS) from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), with correlations higher than 0.85. Surface water storage presents a strong seasonal signal ($\sim$496 km3 estimated by GIEMS/ASTER and $\sim$378 km3 by GIEMS/HyMAPs), representing $\sim$51% and $\sim$41% respectively of the total water storage signal and it exhibits a large inter-annual variability with strong negative anomalies during the drought-like conditions of 1994 or strong positive anomalies such as in 1998.

abstract = {The SMEX02 experiments held in June-July 2002, at Iowa demonstrated the potential of an L band radiometer (PALS) in estimation of near surface soil moisture under dense vegetation canopy conditions. The L band radar was also shown to be sufficiently sensitive to near surface soil moisture. However, the spatial resolution of a typical satellite mounted L band radiometer is of the order of 10's of kilometers which is not sufficient to serve the science needs of land surface hydrology and weather modeling applications. Disaggregation schemes for deriving sub pixel estimates of soil moisture from radiometer data using higher resolution radar observations hold the promise of making global soil moisture observations at much finer scale available. The HYDROS instrument is proposed to have an L band radiometer and L band radar onboard. The passive instrument has spatial resolution of the order of tens of kilometers and operates along with the active instrument that takes observations at a resolution of tens of meters. This paper presents a simple approach for disaggregation of coarser resolution radiometer estimates of soil moisture using higher resolution radar backscatter measurements. The algorithm has been applied to a coincident PALS radar/radiometer and AIRSAR dataset acquired during the SMEX02 campaign View full abstract},

abstract = {Influences of climatic change and anthropogenic activities on the terrestrial water storage (TWS) change are significant in the mid- and high-latitude areas. Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission has provided quantitative measurements of TWS changes with unprecedented accuracy at global, regional and basin scales. In this study, the noise level of various GRACE-derived TWS anomalies (TWSA) data were evaluated by using a generalized three-cornered hat (GTCH) method. A time-dependent weights approach was adopted to obtain a combined TWSA series over the Songhua River Basin (SRB) from 2003 to 2013. Monthly TWSA data during the past decades (1982–2002) were reconstructed by using an artificial neural network (ANN) approach with the good performance evaluated by the correlation coefficient of 0.89 and the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency of 0.79 over the study region. In-situ groundwater level measurements were used for validation of the groundwater storage (GWS) changes (estimated by using GRACE-derived TWS changes in association with the other simulated components of water storage changes from land surface models (LSMs)). The primary driving factors of spatiotemporal variations of GWS, as well as their inter-/intra-annually varying characteristics, were explored. The present study revealed that the variations of GWS featured a “downward fluctuations” (1982–1994), “stable upward” (1998–2008) and “decreasing dramatically” (2009–2013) period, respectively, over the SRB. In general, GWS had varied in a steady decline trend at a decreasing rate of 1.04 ± 0.59 mm year−1 from 1982 to 1994. With the enhanced climatic and anthropogenic influences over the region since 2000, several severe fluctuations characterized the GWS variations with occurrences of spring droughts and flooding over the region, which suggested significant effects of global changes posed on GWS variations of the region.},

abstract = {The CIRSAN/LBA field campaign was conducted close to two major rivers of the Amazon Basin, the Tapaj{\'{o}}s and the Amazon. The observations indicate that during weak trade wind episodes the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River breeze actually induces a westerly flow at the eastern margin with an associated line of shallow cumulus. The atmospheric circulation induced by the river has been interpreted with the help of a high resolution numerical simulation. A single cell forms during late morning over the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River and evolves into the afternoon with ascending motion in the eastern margin and a descending branch in the western margin suppressing cloud formation. During the night, convergence is seen along the centre of the River Tapaj{\'{o}}s. The implications of the particular geometry of the river with respect to the trade winds for the generalization of the surface measurements of turbulent fluxes of heat, moisture and CO2 in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s eastern margin of the Amazon Basin as a whole are discussed. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Groundwater contribution to river flows, generally called base flows, often accounts for a significant proportion of total flow rate, especially during the dry season. The objective of this work is to test simple approaches requiring limited data to understand groundwater contribution to river flows. The Noire river basin in southern Quebec is used as a case study. A lumped conceptual hydrological model (the MOHYSE model), a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW) and hydrograph separation are used to provide estimates of base flow for the study area. Results show that the methods are complementary. Hydrograph separation and the MOHYSE surface flow model provide similar annual estimates for the groundwater contribution to river flow, but monthly base flows can vary significantly between the two methods. Both methods have the advantage of being easily implemented. However, the distinction between aquifer contribution and shallow subsurface contribution to base flow can only be made with a groundwater flow model. The aquifer renewal rate estimated with the MODFLOW model for the Noire River is 30% of the recharge estimated from base flow values. This is a significantly difference which can be crucial for regional-scale water management. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2010. },

abstract = {Surface and atmospheric water balances analysis for Amazon River basin at monthly time scale are performed with an emphasis on the linkages between the Andes and low-lying Amazonia. Analyses are performed using observational and reanalysis data covering five different periods of analysis (depending on length of evapotranspiration data sets) for the entire basin, major subcatchments, and for the Andes and low-lying Amazonia. Results for the entire basin show a state close to balance within tolerance, while the spatial disaggregation produced a less clear picture, presenting major discrepancies between observations and reanalysis data sets. The atmospheric budget exhibits no closure and positive residuals regardless of data set, with the magnitude of residuals for the entire Amazon basin highly dependent on evapotranspiration data source. The imbalance between the two water budgets (14%–16%) is driven by higher values of runoff and by an abrupt change in runoff when changing from dry to wet seasons in the Amazon. We unveil two shortcomings of the available data, namely poor quality in the representation of surface processes by reanalysis, and flaws and scarcity of information in the high Andes that induce uncertainties and errors in both water budgets. The results of the present study highlight the importance of the Andean region for the hydrological integrity of the entire Amazon River basin. Our results confirm the paramount importance of the joint analysis of atmospheric and surface water budgets at the basin level with respect to achieving a complete understanding of the whole hydrological cycle at the continental scale.},

Diurnal warming most typically reaches maximum values of 3°C, although very localized events may reach 7°–8°C. An analysis of multiple years of diurnal warming over the global ice-free oceans indicates that heat fluxes determined by using the predawn sea surface temperature can differ by more than 100% in localized regions over those in which the sea surface temperature is allowed to fluctuate on a diurnal basis. A comparison of flux climatologies produced by these two analyses demonstrates that significant portions of the tropical oceans experience differences on a yearly average of up to 10 W m−2. Regions with the highest climatological differences include the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, as well as the equatorial western and eastern Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the western coasts of Central America and North Africa.

abstract = {Drawing upon a variety of existing maps, data and information, a new Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) has been created. The combination of best available sources for lakes and wetlands on a global scale (1:1 to 1:3 million resolution), and the application of Geographic Information System (GIS) functionality enabled the generation of a database which focuses in three coordinated levels on (1) large lakes and reservoirs, (2) smaller water bodies, and (3) wetlands. Level 1 comprises the shoreline polygons of the 3067 largest lakes (surface area $\ge$50 km 2) and 654 largest reservoirs (storage capacity $\ge$0.5 km 3) worldwide, and offers extensive attribute data. Level 2 contains the shoreline polygons of approx. 250,000 smaller lakes, reservoirs and rivers (surface area $\ge$0.1 km 2), excluding all water bodies of level 1. Finally, level 3 represents lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and different wetland types in the form of a global raster map at 30-second resolution, including all water bodies of levels 1 and 2. In a validation against documented data, GLWD proved to represent a comprehensive database of global lakes $\ge$1 km 2 and to provide a good representation of the maximum global wetland extent. GLWD-1 and GLWD-2 establish two global polygon maps to which existing lake registers, compilations or remote sensing data can be linked in order to allow for further analyses in a GIS environment. GLWD-3 may serve as an estimate of wetland extents for global hydrology and climatology models, or to identify large-scale wetland distributions and important wetland complexes.},

abstract = {The transport of freshwater from continents to oceans through rivers has traditionally been estimated by routing runoff from land surface models within river models to obtain discharge. This paradigm imposes that errors are transferred from runoff to discharge, yet the analytical propagation of uncertainty from runoff to discharge has never been derived. Here we apply statistics to the continuity equation within a river network to derive two equations that propagate the mean and variance/covariance of runoff errors independently. We validate these equations in a case study of the rivers in the western United States and, for the first time, invert observed discharge errors for spatially distributed runoff errors. Our results suggest that the largest discharge error source is the joint variability of runoff errors across space, not the mean or amplitude of individual errors. Our findings significantly advance the science of error quantification in model-based estimates of river discharge.},

abstract = {The availability of highly accessible and reliable monthly gridded data sets of global land-surface precipitation is a need that was already identified in the mid-1980s when there was a complete lack of globally homogeneous gauge-based precipitation analyses. Since 1989, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) has built up its unique capacity to assemble, quality assure, and analyse rain gauge data gathered from all over the world. The resulting database has exceeded 200 yr in temporal coverage and has acquired data from more than 85 000 stations worldwide. Based on this database, this paper provides the reference publication for the four globally gridded monthly precipitation products of the GPCC, covering a 111-yr analysis period from 1901&ndash;present. As required for a reference publication, the content of the product portfolio, as well as the underlying methodologies to process and interpolate are detailed. Moreover, we provide information on the systematic and statistical errors associated with the data products. Finally, sample applications provide potential users of GPCC data products with suitable advice on capabilities and constraints of the gridded data sets. In doing so, the capabilities to access El Ni{\~{n}}o&ndash;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) sensitive precipitation regions and to perform trend analyses across the past 110 yr are demonstrated. The four gridded products, i.e. the Climatology (CLIM) V2011, the Full Data Reanalysis (FD) V6, the Monitoring Product (MP) V4, and the First Guess Product (FG), are publicly available on easily accessible latitude/longitude grids encoded in zipped clear text ASCII files for subsequent visualization and download through the GPCC download gate hosted on ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/data/gpcc/html/download-gate.html by the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), Offenbach, Germany. Depending on the product, four (0.25°, 0.5°, 1.0°, 2.5° for CLIM), three (0.5°, 1.0°, 2.5°, for FD), two (1.0°, 2.5° for MP) or one (1.0° for FG) resolution is provided, and for each product a DOI reference is provided allowing for public user access to the products. A preliminary description of the scope of a fifth product &ndash; the Homogenized Precipitation Analysis (HOMPRA) &ndash; is also provided. Its comprehensive description will be submitted later in an extra paper upon completion of this data product.

abstract = {<p>Abstract. Tropical forests have been a permanent feature of the Amazon basin for at least 55 million years, yet climate change and land use threaten the forest's future over the next century. Understory forest fires, which are common under the current climate in frontier forests, may accelerate Amazon forest losses from climate-driven dieback and deforestation. Far from land use frontiers, scarce fire ignitions and high moisture levels preclude significant burning, yet projected climate and land use changes may increase fire activity in these remote regions. Here, we used a fire model specifically parameterized for Amazon understory fires to examine the interactions between anthropogenic activities and climate under current and projected conditions. In a scenario of low mitigation efforts with substantial land use expansion and climate change – Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 – projected understory fires increase in frequency and duration, burning 4–28 times more forest in 2080–2100 than during 1990–2010. In contrast, active climate mitigation and land use contraction in RCP4.5 constrain the projected increase in fire activity to 0.9–5.4 times contemporary burned area. Importantly, if climate mitigation is not successful, land use contraction alone is very effective under low to moderate climate change, but does little to reduce fire activity under the most severe climate projections. These results underscore the potential for a fire-driven transformation of Amazon forests if recent regional policies for forest conservation are not paired with global efforts to mitigate climate change.</p>},

abstract = {Abstract Two new high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) analysis products have been developed using optimum interpolation (OI). The analyses have a spatial grid resolution of 0.25° and a temporal resolution of 1 day. One product uses the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared satellite SST data. The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR's near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1° OI analyses.

abstract = {Large-scale hydrological models are nowadays mostly calibrated using observed discharge. As a result, a large part of the hydrological system, in particular the unsaturated zone, remains uncalibrated. Soil moisture observations from satellites have the potential to fill this gap. Here we evaluate the added value of remotely sensed soil moisture in calibration of large-scale hydrological models by addressing two research questions: (1) Which parameters of hydrological models can be identified by calibration with remotely sensed soil moisture? (2) Does calibration with remotely sensed soil moisture lead to an improved calibration of hydrological models compared to calibration based only on discharge observations, such that this leads to improved simulations of soil moisture content and discharge? A dual state and parameter Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to calibrate the hydrological model LISFLOOD for the Upper Danube. Calibration is done using discharge and remotely sensed soil moisture acquired by AMSR-E, SMOS, and ASCAT. Calibration with discharge data improves the estimation of groundwater and routing parameters. Calibration with only remotely sensed soil moisture results in an accurate identification of parameters related to land-surface processes. For the Upper Danube upstream area up to 40,000 km2, calibration on both discharge and soil moisture results in a reduction by 10–30% in the RMSE for discharge simulations, compared to calibration on discharge alone. The conclusion is that remotely sensed soil moisture holds potential for calibration of hydrological models, leading to a better simulation of soil moisture content throughout the catchment and a better simulation of discharge in upstream areas.},

abstract = {In the Amazon River basin, water stored for months to years in the soils and subsurface provide a persistent resource that regulates local and global climate via teleconnections and provides water to plants in times of little rain. While Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have provided the hydrological community with large advances in the understanding of large river basin dynamics and for water resources monitoring applications, the relative storage measurements from GRACE satellites have not yet been utilized for the quantification of total available freshwater on landmasses. In this study, we quantify the total drainable water storage (TDWS) in the Amazon basin by characterizing the relationship between the water storage anomaly of a large catchment and its base flow. Previous studies have shown that these two hydrological parameters behave like a linear time-independent system over a catchment like the Amazon dominated by fully humid tropical climate. This linear relationship allows us to determine a zero water storage level, at which the storage-driven discharge becomes zero. We quantify the TDWS of the Amazon basin as 1,766 km3 and estimate an average 2 month residence time for stored waters. An independent analysis over nine major subbasins confirms our estimate for the entire basin. We show that our estimated TDWS values for individual subbasins, varying between 15 and 654 km3, follow two different linear relationships with their mean annual input. Through these relationships we also quantify the storage-driven portion of the streamflow and the total streamflow for Amazon and its subbasins. Furthermore, we estimate surface water storage variation of the Amazon River system by combining the water level time series from satellite altimetry and surface water extent time series from satellite imagery. Our results show that 61% of total basin water storage variation occurs in the surface water compartment. In addition, we find that 65% of the TDWS is available in its surface water system.},

These regional maps are used to describe and quantify water mass change. The contribution of African hydrology to actual sea level rise is negative and small in magnitude (i.e., −0.1 mm/y of equivalent sea level (ESL)) mainly explained by the water retained in the Zambezi River basin. Analysis of the regional water mass maps is used to distinguish different zones of important water mass variations, with the exception of the dominant seasonal cycle of the African monsoon in the Sahel and Central Africa. The analysis of the regional solutions reveals the accumulation in the Okavango swamp and South Niger. It confirms the continuous depletion of water in the North Sahara aquifer at the rate of −2.3 km3/y, with a decrease in early 2008. Synergistic use of altimetry-based lake water volume with total water storage (TWS) from GRACE permits a continuous monitoring of sub-surface water storage for large lake drainage areas. These different applications demonstrate the potential of the GRACE mission for the management of water resources at the regional scale.},

abstract = {On the Tibetan Plateau, the limited ground-based rainfall information owing to a harsh environment has brought great challenges to hydrological studies. Satellite-based rainfall products, which allow for a better coverage than both radar network and rain gauges on the Tibetan Plateau, can be suitable alternatives for studies on investigating the hydrological processes and climate change. In this study, a newly developed daily satellite-based precipitation product, termed Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), is used as input for a hydrologic model to simulate streamflow in the upper Yellow and Yangtze River basins on the Tibetan Plateau. The results show that the simulated streamflows using PERSIANN-CDR precipitation and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) precipitation are closer to observation than that using limited gauge-based precipitation interpolation in the upper Yangtze River basin. The simulated streamflow using gauge-based precipitation are higher than the streamflow observation during the wet season. In the upper Yellow River basin, gauge-based precipitation, GLDAS precipitation, and PERSIANN-CDR precipitation have similar good performance in simulating streamflow. The evaluation of streamflow simulation capability in this study partly indicates that the PERSIANN-CDR rainfall product has good potential to be a reliable dataset and an alternative information source of a limited gauge network for conducting long-term hydrological and climate studies on the Tibetan Plateau.},

abstract = {Continental moisture recycling is a crucial process of the South American climate system. In particular, evapotranspiration from the Amazon basin contributes substantially to precipitation regionally as well as over other remote regions such as the La Plata basin. Here we present an in-depth analysis of South American moisture recycling mechanisms. In particular, we quantify the importance of cascading moisture recycling (CMR), which describes moisture transport between two locations on the continent that involves re-evaporation cycles along the way. Using an Eulerian atmospheric moisture tracking model forced by a combination of several historical climate data sets, we were able to construct a complex network of moisture recycling for South America. Our results show that CMR contributes about 9-10% to the total precipitation over South America and 17-18% over the La Plata basin. CMR increases the fraction of total precipitation over the La Plata basin that originates from the Amazon basin from 18-23 to 24-29% during the wet season. We also show that the south-western part of the Amazon basin is not only a direct source of rainfall over the La Plata basin, but also a key intermediary region that distributes moisture originating from the entire Amazon basin towards the La Plata basin during the wet season. Our results suggest that land use change in this region might have a stronger impact on downwind rainfall than previously thought. Using complex network analysis techniques, we find the eastern side of the sub-tropical Andes to be a key region where CMR pathways are channeled. This study offers a better understanding of the interactions between the vegetation and the atmosphere on the water cycle, which is needed in a context of land use and climate change in South America.},

abstract = {Surface water storage and fluxes in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and
wetlands are currently poorly observed at the global scale, even though
they represent major components of the water cycle and deeply impact
human societies. In situ networks are heterogeneously distributed in
space, and many river basins and most lakes-especially in the developing
world and in sparsely populated regions-remain unmonitored. Satellite
remote sensing has provided useful complementary observations, but no
past or current satellite mission has yet been specifically designed to
observe, at the global scale, surface water storage change and fluxes.
This is the purpose of the planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography
(SWOT) satellite mission. SWOT is a collaboration between the (US)
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Centre National d'Etudes
Spatiales (the French Spatial Agency), the Canadian Space Agency and the
United Kingdom Space Agency, with launch planned in late 2020. SWOT is
both a continental hydrology and oceanography mission. However, only the
hydrology capabilities of SWOT are discussed here. After a description
of the SWOT mission requirements and measurement capabilities, we review
the SWOT-related studies concerning land hydrology published to date.
Beginning in 2007, studies demonstrated the benefits of SWOT data for
river hydrology, both through discharge estimation directly from SWOT
measurements and through assimilation of SWOT data into hydrodynamic and
hydrology models. A smaller number change or have quantified
improvements expected from SWOT compared with current knowledge of lake
water storage variability. We also briefly review other land hydrology
capabilities of SWOT, including those related to transboundary river
basins, human water withdrawals and wetland environments. Finally, we
discuss additional studies needed before and after the launch of the
mission, along with perspectives on a potential successor to SWOT.},

abstract = {In this second part of the two-part series, we discuss the formulation and implementation of groundwater processes into an existing climate model, by linking a groundwater reservoir and a rivers-lakes reservoir with its land surface scheme. We present the parameterization and validation of these processes with river flow and soil moisture observations. We use the new scheme as a tool to investigate the role of the groundwater reservoir in controlling the spatial and temporal structure of large-scale soil moisture fields. We find that where the water table is shallow, the groundwater reservoir is linked to the soil water reservoir through two-way fluxes. At these locations, the role of the groundwater shifts from being primarily a sink to being primarily a source for the soil, as the season progresses from the wet spring to the dry autumn. Through the two-way fluxes, groundwater exerts a certain degree of control on the root zone soil moisture fields; there is an apparent spatial correlation between the distribution of shallow water table and wet soil. Since the water table reflects long-term climatic and topographic forcing and exhibits strong spatial organization, its link to the soil moisture gives the latter a certain degree of spatial organization as well. The slow changing nature of the water table acts to stabilize the temporal variations in soil water, giving the latter stronger seasonal persistence.

The methodology is based on topography and hydrography information from the HydroSHEDS database. A new floodability index is introduced and an innovative smoothing procedure is developed to ensure a smooth transition, in the high-resolution maps, between the low-resolution boxes from GIEMS. Topography information is pertinent for natural hydrology environments controlled by elevation but is more limited in human-modified basins. However, the proposed downscaling approach is compatible with forthcoming fusion of other, more pertinent satellite information in these difficult regions. The resulting GIEMS-D3 database is the only high-spatial-resolution inundation database available globally at a monthly time scale over the 1993–2007 period. GIEMS-D3 is assessed by analyzing its spatial and temporal variability and evaluated by comparisons to other independent satellite observations from visible (Google Earth and Landsat), infrared (MODIS), and active microwave (synthetic aperture radar).</p>},

Its magnitude can be as large as soil moisture perturbing the motions of the satellites to a detectable amount by the on-board instrument. The river runoff routing simulations indicate the effective velocity throughout the Amazon basin over the years is about 30 cm/s with significant seasonal change. The lower velocity, during rising stages and peak water season, and the faster velocity, during falling stages, are delineated from the observations.

abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach to recover water mass changes from GRACE satellite data at a daily temporal resolution. Such a product can be beneficial in monitoring extreme weather events that last a few days and are missing by conventional monthly GRACE data. The determination of the distribution of these water mass sources over networks of juxtaposed triangular tiles was made using Kalman Filtering (KF) of daily GRACE geopotential difference observations that were reduced for isolating the continental hydrology contribution of the measured gravity field. Geopotential differences were obtained from the along-track K-Band Range Rate (KBRR) measurements according to the method of energy integral. The recovery approach was validated by inverting synthetic GRACE geopotential differences simulated using GLDAS/WGHM global hydrology model outputs. Series of daily regional and global KF solutions were estimated from real GRACE KBRR data for the period 2003&ndash;2012. They provide a realistic description of hydrological fluxes at monthly time scales, which are consistent with classical spherical harmonics and mascons solutions provided by the GRACE official centers but also give an intra-month/daily continuity of these variations.},

abstract = {Spaceborne digital elevation models (DEMs) are a fundamental input for many geoscience studies, but they still include nonnegligible height errors. Here we introduce a high-accuracy global DEM at 3″ resolution ($\sim$90 m at the equator) by eliminating major error components from existing DEMs. We separated absolute bias, stripe noise, speckle noise, and tree height bias using multiple satellite data sets and filtering techniques. After the error removal, land areas mapped with ±2 m or better vertical accuracy were increased from 39% to 58%. Significant improvements were found in flat regions where height errors larger than topography variability, and landscapes such as river networks and hill-valley structures, became clearly represented. We found the topography slope of previous DEMs was largely distorted in most of world major floodplains (e.g., Ganges, Nile, Niger, and Mekong) and swamp forests (e.g., Amazon, Congo, and Vasyugan). The newly developed DEM will enhance many geoscience applications which are terrain dependent.},

abstract = {The Amazon basin hosts half the planet's remaining moist tropical forests, but they may be threatened in a warming world. Nevertheless, climate model predictions vary from rapid drying to modest wetting. Here we report that the catchment of the world's largest river is experiencing a substantial wetting trend since approximately 1990. This intensification of the hydrological cycle is concentrated overwhelmingly in the wet season driving progressively greater differences in Amazon peak and minimum flows. The onset of the trend coincides with the onset of an upward trend in tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). This positive longer-term correlation contrasts with the short-term, negative response of basin- wide precipitation to positive anomalies in tropical North Atlantic SST, which are driven by temporary shifts in the intertropical convergence zone position. We propose that the Amazon precipitation changes since 1990 are instead related to increasing atmospheric water vapor import from the warming tropical Atlantic},

abstract = {A suite of climate change indices derived from daily temperature and precipitation data, with a primary focus on extreme events, were computed and analyzed. By setting an exact formula for each index and using specially designed software, analyses done in different countries have been combined seamlessly. This has enabled the presentation of the most up-to-date and comprehensive global picture of trends in extreme temperature and precipitation indices using results from a number of workshops held in data-sparse regions and high-quality station data supplied by numerous scientists world wide. Seasonal and annual indices for the period 1951-2003 were gridded. Trends in the gridded fields were computed and tested for statistical significance. Results showed widespread significant changes in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature. Over 70% of the global land area sampled showed a significant decrease in the annual occurrence of cold nights and a significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm nights. Some regions experienced a more than doubling of these indices. This implies a positive shift in the distribution of daily minimum temperature throughout the globe. Daily maximum temperature indices showed similar changes but with smaller magnitudes. Precipitation changes showed a widespread and significant increase, but the changes are much less spatially coherent compared with temperature change. Probability distributions of indices derived from approximately 200 temperature and 600 precipitation stations, with near-complete data for 1901-2003 and covering a very large region of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (and parts of Australia for precipitation) were analyzed for the periods 1901-1950, 1951-1978 and 1979-2003. Results indicate a significant warming throughout the 20th century. Differences in temperature indices distributions are particularly pronounced between the most recent two periods and for those indices related to minimum temperature. An analysis of those indices for which seasonal time series are available shows that these changes occur for all seasons although they are generally least pronounced for September to November. Precipitation indices show a tendency toward wetter conditions throughout the 20th century.},

How many linear measurements do we need to make about f to be able to recover f to within precision epsi in the Euclidean (lscr2) metric? This paper shows that if the objects of interest are sparse in a fixed basis or compressible, then it is possible to reconstruct f to within very high accuracy from a small number of random measurements by solving a simple linear program. More precisely, suppose that the nth largest entry of the vector |f| (or of its coefficients in a fixed basis) obeys |f|(n)lesRmiddotn-1p/, where R>0 and p>0. Suppose that we take measurements yk=langf{\#} ,Xkrang,k=1,...,K, where the Xk are N-dimensional Gaussian vectors with independent standard normal entries. Then for each f obeying the decay estimate above for some 0<p<1 and with overwhelming probability, our reconstruction ft, defined as the solution to the constraints yk=langf{\#} ,Xkrang with minimal lscr1 norm, obeys parf-f{\#}parlscr2lesCp middotRmiddot(K/logN)-r, r=1/p-1/2. There is a sense in which this result is optimal; it is generally impossible to obtain a higher accuracy from any set of K measurements whatsoever.

abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall are governed by complex interactions between climate and landscape perturbations including deforestation, fire, and drought. Previous research demonstrated that rainfall in portions of the Amazon Basin has intensified, resulting in more extreme droughts and floods. The basin has global impacts on climate and hydrologic cycles; thus, it is critical to understand how precipitation patterns and intensity are changing. Due to insufficient precipitation gauges, we analyzed the variability and seasonality of rainfall over the Amazon Basin from 1982 to 2018 using high-resolution gridded precipitation products. We developed several precipitation indices and analyzed their trends using the Mann–Kendall test (Mann 1945; Kendall, 1975) to identify significant changes in rainfall patterns over time and space. Our results show landscape scale changes in the timing and intensity of rainfall events. Specifically, wet areas of the western Basin have become significantly wetter since 1982, with an increase of 182 mm of rainfall per year. In the eastern and southern regions, where deforestation is widespread, a significant drying trend is evident. Additionally, local alterations to precipitation patterns were also observed. For example, the Tocantins region has had a significant increase in the number of dry days during both wet and dry seasons, increasing by about 1 day per year. Surprisingly, changes in rainfall amount and number of dry days do not consistently align. Broadly, over this 37-year period, wet areas are trending wetter and dry areas are trending drier, while spatial anomalies show structure at the scale of hundreds of kilometers.},

Conventional observations through surface gauge networks provide the most direct measure of precipitation, although these are very much limited to land areas, with very few in situ measurements over the oceans. Weather radars, although providing a spatial measure of precipitation, are limited in extent and number. Satellite observations offer an unrivalled vantage point to observe precipitation on a global basis. Since precipitation is spatially and temporally highly variable, satellites are able to provide temporal and spatial samples commensurate with many precipitation characteristics.

abstract = {This paper focuses on the representation of the air surface temperature and precipitation using high spatiotemporal simulations (3 km–1 h) of the WRF3.7.1 model in the central Peruvian area. It covers, from east to west, the coastal zone, the western slope of the Andes, the Andean Mantaro basin (500–5000 masl), and the Andes-Amazon transition region in the eastern Andes. The study covers the January months from 2004 to 2008. Three experiments were conducted using different topography and land use data sources: (1) a control simulation using the default WRF topography and land use datasets from the United States Geological Survey (USGS); (2) a simulation changing only the topography by using the SRTM topography dataset; and (3) a simulation changing the land use data of (2) by a new dataset adapted from Eva et al. (2004). SRTM topography performed better than the control simulation for representing the actual altitudes of 57 meteorological stations that were used for precipitation and surface air temperature data. As a result, the simulations of experiments (2) and (3) produced lower bias values than that of (1). Topography change (experiment (2)) showed improvements in temperature bias that were directly associated with linear modifications of -5.6 and -6.7 °C∙km−1 in minimum and maximum temperature, respectively. Increasing (decreasing) precipitation with topography or land use change was clearly controlled by changes in the moisture flux patterns and its convergence (divergence) in the Andes-Amazon transition. On the western slope, precipitation increase could be associated with the increase in easterly flow by the smaller altitudes of the Andes mountains in SRTM topography and by increasing evaporation with new land use. Inside the Mantaro Basin, low level moisture flux seems to control the rainfall changes. Overall, relative changes (positive or negative) in precipitation due to topography or land use change could reach values above 25%.},

abstract = {Nearly one-fifth of the Earth's accessible freshwater is stored in the densely-populated, alluvial floodplains of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, Indus, Irrawaddy and Meghna River Systems in the Himalayan region where extreme hydrological conditions exist due to the seasonal variability in terrestrial water storage (TWS). Groundwater storage (GWS) – a hidden resource underneath the land surface, plays a critical role in sustaining irrigated agriculture in these river basins, particularly during the dry season when rice crops are generally grown in irrigated lands across South Asia. Although monitoring of groundwater levels has been operational in the region for a number of decades, a basin-wide comprehensive assessment of GWS is lacking in most river basins. The NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellites offer an opportunity to map basin-wide changes in GWS where in-situ observations are limited in time and space. GRACE-derived assessments of GWS vary substantially in these basins and have not been reconciled with in-situ observations in most cases. Recent declining trends in GWS over the Himalayan river basins are attributed primarily to over-abstraction of groundwater due to dry-season irrigation. Seasonal variability in terrestrial water is likely to increase or become unpredictable in the future as a result of increased climate variability. The consequent impacts may potentially threaten the security of water supply and food in the region, where there is currently a growing demand for food grains from irrigated agriculture, energy, and domestic and industrial water supplies.},

abstract = {The new IMERG and GSMaP-v6 satellite rainfall estimation (SRE) products from the Global Precipitation Monitoring (GPM) mission have been available since January 2015. With a finer grid box of 0.1°, these products should provide more detailed information than their latest widely-adapted (relatively coarser spatial scale, 0.25°) counterpart. Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation version 6 (GSMaP-v6) assessment is done by comparing their rainfall estimations with 247 rainfall gauges from 2014 to 2016 in Bolivia. The comparisons were done on annual, monthly and daily temporal scales over the three main national watersheds (Amazon, La Plata and TDPS), for both wet and dry seasons to assess the seasonal variability and according to different slope classes to assess the topographic influence on SREs. To observe the potential enhancement in rainfall estimates brought by these two recently released products, the widely-used TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product is also considered in the analysis. The performances of all the products increase during the wet season. Slightly less accurate than TMPA, IMERG can almost achieve its main objective, which is to ensure TMPA rainfall measurements, while enhancing the discretization of rainy and non-rainy days. It also provides the most accurate estimates among all products over the Altiplano arid region. GSMaP-v6 is the least accurate product over the region and tends to underestimate rainfall over the Amazon and La Plata regions. Over the Amazon and La Plata region, SRE potentiality is related to topographic features with the highest bias observed over high slope regions. Over the TDPS watershed, the high rainfall spatial variability with marked wet and arid regions is the main factor influencing SREs.},

abstract = {New precipitation (P) datasets are released regularly, following innovations in weather forecasting models, satellite retrieval methods, and multi-source merging techniques. Using the conterminous US as a case study, we evaluated the performance of 26 gridded (sub-)daily P datasets to obtain insight into the merit of these innovations. The evaluation was performed at a daily timescale for the period 2008-2017 using the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), a performance metric combining correlation, bias, and variability. As a reference, we used the high-resolution (4 km) Stage-IV gauge-radar P dataset. Among the three KGE components, the P datasets performed worst overall in terms of correlation (related to event identification). In terms of improving KGE scores for these datasets, improved P totals (affecting the bias score) and improved distribution of P intensity (affecting the variability score) are of secondary importance. Among the 11 gauge-corrected P datasets, the best overall performance was obtained by MSWEP V2.2, underscoring the importance of applying daily gauge corrections and accounting for gauge reporting times. Several uncorrected P datasets outperformed gauge-corrected ones. Among the 15 uncorrected P datasets, the best performance was obtained by the ERA5-HRES fourth-generation reanalysis, reflecting the significant advances in earth system modeling during the last decade. The (re)analyses generally performed better in winter than in summer, while the opposite was the case for the satellite-based datasets. IMERGHH V05 performed substantially better than TMPA-3B42RT V7, attributable to the many improvements implemented in the IMERG satellite P retrieval algorithm. IMERGHH V05 outperformed ERA5-HRES in regions dominated by convective storms, while the opposite was observed in regions of complex terrain. The ERA5-EDA ensemble average exhibited higher correlations than the ERA5-HRES deterministic run, highlighting the value of ensemble modeling. The WRF regional convectionpermitting climate model showed considerably more accurate P totals over the mountainous west and performed best among the uncorrected datasets in terms of variability, suggesting there is merit in using high-resolution models to obtain climatological P statistics. Our findings provide some guidance to choose the most suitable P dataset for a particular application.},

The approach (1) enables the use of the spatial resolution provided by GRACE by including the satellite observations as a gridded data product, (2) accounts for the complex spatial GRACE error correlation pattern by rigorous error propagation from the monthly GRACE solutions, and (3) allows us to integrate model parameter calibration and data assimilation within a unified framework. We investigate the formal contribution of GRACE observations to the Kalman filter update by analysis of the Kalman gain matrix. We then present first model runs, calibrated via data assimilation, for two different experiments: the first one assimilates GRACE basin averages of total water storage and the second one introduces gridded GRACE data at 5∘ resolution into the assimilation. We finally validate the assimilated model by running it in free mode (i.e., without adding any further GRACE information) for a period of 3 years following the assimilation phase and comparing the results to the GRACE observations available for this period.},

abstract = {River systems play a pivotal role in transporting and transforming organic carbon (OC) fixed by terrestrial primary production. However, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the connectivity of terrestrial, aquatic, and marine carbon budgets due to a lack of measurements along the lower (i.e. tidally-influenced) reaches of large river systems. For example, all estimates of carbon fluxes from the world's largest river, the Amazon, are based on measurements made at and upstream of {\'{O}}bidos, roughly 900. km from the mouth. Here we examine the evolution of OC concentrations and composition from {\'{O}}bidos to two discreet channels near the mouth of the Amazon River during five cruises from 2010 to 2012. OC characteristics of the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River, which enters the Amazon River downstream of {\'{O}}bidos, and the Tocantins River, which mixes with the Amazon River plume in the Atlantic Ocean, were also assessed.The average concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) across the two main channels near the mouth was 0.6±0.3mgL-1 during the study period, decreasing from 1.2±1.0mgL-1 at {\'{O}}bidos. Average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, on the other hand, increased from 3.9±0.6 mgL-1 at {\'{O}}bidos to 4.2±0.9 mgL-1 across the mouth. The discharge of total OC to the ocean was composed of 89±3% dissolved load, compared to 76±13% at {\'{O}}bidos. Measurements of bulk OC stable isotopic signatures, chlorophyll a concentrations, and lignin phenol abundance were used to assess unique OC sources along the continuum. For example, the stable isotopic composition of POC and DOC indicated a replacement of highland forest-derived OC with lowland and floodplain-derived OC from {\'{O}}bidos to the mouth. Likewise, lignin phenol signatures showed an increase in the degradation state of vascular plant-derived OC from {\'{O}}bidos to the mouth. Results from this study illustrate that the abundance and composition of OC continue to evolve along the lower reaches of large tropical rivers, which has significant implications on estimations of geochemical fluxes to the ocean.},

abstract = {Mesoscale to synoptic-scale squall lines that form along the northeastern coast of South America as sea-breeze-induced instability lines and propagate through the Amazon Basin are investigated using data collected during the April–May 1987 Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE 2B).These systems, termed “Amazon coastal squall lines” (ACSL), have been noted by others, but details of the structure and evolution of the ACSL are limited. The present paper uses Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, radar, upper-air rawinsonde, and surface Portable Automated Mesonet data to describe the structure, dynamics, and life cycle of the ACSL. Twelve ACSL were sampled during ABLE 2B, and three cases are discussed in detail.The ACSL are discontinuous lines of organized mesoscale cloud clusters that propagate across the central Amazon Basin at speeds of 50–60 km h−1. The ACSL undergo six possible life cycle stages: coastal genesis, intensification, maturity, weakening, reintensification, and dissipation. Analysis also indicates that mesoscale clusters within the ACSL are composed of three distinct cloud components: a prestorm region that often contains towering cumulus, leading edge convection (LEC), and multiple, precipitating cloud layers in the trailing stratiform region (TSR).Divergence and vertical velocity calculations indicate deep vertical ascent in the LEC and a region of midlevel convergence (≈500 mb) in the TSR. The latter midlevel convergence is associated with a weak updraft above 500 mb and an unsaturated downdraft below. Vertical motions in the TSR are an order of magnitude smaller than in the LEC.Substantial shear in the low-level inflow occurs in all three case studies and, as suggested by model simulations, may play an important role in the longevity (24–48 h) of the ACSL. Profiles of equivalent potential temperature $\theta$e, taken from the prestorm, leading edge convection and trailing stratiform regions demonstrate that the ACSL stabilize the troposphere in their wake and remove a tropospheric minimum of $\theta$e. It is hypothesized that the removal of this minimum is accomplished both by direct mixing via vertical motions in the LEC ("hot towers") and also through detrainment in the multiple-layered TSR. Part I describes the structure and kinematics of the ACSL, while Part II deals with the heat and moisture transports of these systems.},

abstract = {Although satellite-based precipitation estimation has extensive application potential, validation of its reliability is challenging for areas lacking ground-based data which is particularly true for many arid and semiarid regions. The triple collocation (TC) method can be used to evaluate three independent inputs with unknown true values, and thus provides an appealing alternative for assessment of satellite precipitation products in lack of observation regions. This study is the first to utilize TC to comprehensively assess the uncertainties of various satellite precipitation products in Central Asia (CA) with a distinctive continental arid and semi-arid climate. TC requires the errors of inputs to be independent with each other, while many multi-satellite precipitation products use overlapped data sources. To address this problem, this study uses a soil moisture-based product (SM2RAIN) and a reanalysis model-based product (ERA5) as two inputs of a triplet with the last input coming from each one of the six satellite precipitation products (3B42, CHIRPS, CMORPH, GSMaP, IMERG, PERSIANN). Six independent triplets are obtained in this way. The temporal/spatial resolution is daily/0.1° and the period is 2007–2019. The results show the overall performance of GSMaP is best among eight gridded precipitation products over CA, followed by IMERG, CMORPH and PERSIANN. All precipitation products show degraded performance with increasing altitude. Moreover, the accuracy estimates are subjected to uncertainties caused by the TC method and data inputs. Overall, the study concludes the TC method can provide a new perspective for the assessment of precipitation products over data-absent arid and semiarid regions, while careful check and explanation of evaluation results are always necessary to defend the rationality of TC in specific cases.},

In order to fulfill the requirement of global coverage, existing products integrate satellite-derived retrievals from many sensors with direct ground observations (gauges, disdrometers, radars), which are used as reference for the satellites. While the resulting product can be deemed as the best-available source of quality validation data, awareness of the limitations of such data sets is important to avoid extracting wrong or unsubstantiated conclusions when assessing climate model abilities. This paper provides guidance on the use of precipitation data sets for climate research, including model validation and verification for improving physical parameterizations. The strengths and limitations of the data sets for climate modeling applications are presented, and a protocol for quality assurance of both observational databases and models is discussed.

abstract = {This study provides an updated analysis of the evolution of seasonal rainfall intensity in the Amazon basin, considering the 1981–2017 period and based on HOP (interpolated HYBAM observed precipitation) and CHIRPS (The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations) rainfall data sets. Dry and wet day frequencies as well as extreme percentiles are used in this analysis, producing the same results. Dry-day frequency (DDF) significantly increases in the Southern Amazon (p < 0.01), particularly during September–November (SON) in the Bolivian Amazon, central Peruvian Amazon and far southern Brazilian Amazon. Consistently, total rainfall in the southern Amazon during SON also shows a significant diminution (p < 0.05), estimated at 18%. The increase in SON DDF in the southern Amazon is related to a warming of the northern tropical Atlantic Ocean and a weakening of water vapour flux from the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The increase in DDF in the southern Amazon is related to enhanced wind subsidence (ascendance) over the 10°S–20°S (5°S–5°N) region and to a deficit (excess) of specific humidity at 1000–300 hPa south of 10°S (north of the 5°S), which suggest a reduction of deep convection over southern Amazonia. Subsidence over the southern Amazon shows a significant trend (p < 0.01), which can explain the significant increase in DDF. Wet-day frequency (WDF) significantly increases in the northern Amazon, particularly during the March–May (MAM) period (p < 0.01), producing an estimated rainfall increase during MAM of 17% (p < 0.01) between 1981 and 2017. Significant changes in both WDF and rainfall in northern Amazon have been detected in 1998 (p < 0.01). After 1998, the increase in MAM WDF and rainfall is explained by enhanced moisture flux from the tropical North Atlantic Ocean and an increase in deep convection over the northern and northwestern Amazon. These evolutions in DDF and WDF and in the tropical atmosphere occur simultaneously with an increase in sea surface temperature in the northern Atlantic Ocean, particularly after the mid-1990s. These results provide new insight into rainfall variability and climatic features related to increasing dry season length in southern Amazonia. Severe recent droughts may be associated with the increase in DDF in the South. In addition, the increase in MAM rainfall intensity in northern Amazon after 1998 may be associated with several historical floods that occurred after this date.},

Therefore, a better representation of this variable in the Land-Surface Models (LSMs) used in climate modelling could significantly reduce the uncertainties associated with future climate predictions. In this study, the ESA-CCI soil moisture (SM) combined product (v4.2) has been confronted to the simulated top-first layers/cms of the ORCHIDEE LSM (the continental part of the IPSL Earth System Model) for the years 2008-2016, to evaluate its potential to improve the model using data assimilation techniques. The ESA-CCI data are first rescaled to match the climatology of the model and the signal representative depth is selected. Results are found to be relatively consistent over the first 20 cm of the model. Strong correlations found between the model and the ESA-CCI product show that ORCHIDEE can adequately reproduce the observed SM dynamics. As well as considering two different atmospheric forcings to drive the model, we consider two different model parameterizations related to the soil resistance to evaporation. The correlation metric is shown to be more sensitive to the choice of meteorological forcing than to the choice of model parameterization. Therefore, the metric is not optimal in highlighting structural deficiencies in the model. In contrast, the temporal autocorrelation metric is shown to be more sensitive to this model parameterization, making the metric a potential candidate for future data assimilation experiments.</p>},

Here we compare updated estimates of groundwater storage changes in the California Central Valley using GRACE satellites with storage changes from groundwater level data. A new processing approach was applied that optimally uses available GRACE and water balance component data to extract changes in groundwater storage. GRACE satellites show that groundwater depletion totaled 31.0 6 3.0 km3 for Groupe de Recherche de Geodesie Spatiale (GRGS) satellite data during the drought from October 2006 through March 2010. Groundwater storage changes from GRACE agreed with those from well data for the overlap period (April 2006 through September 2009) (27 km3 for both). General correspondence between GRACE and groundwater level data validates the methodology and increases confidence in use of GRACE satellites to monitor groundwater storage changes.},

The gravity models developed with this data are more than an order of magnitude better at the long and mid wavelengths than previous models. The error estimates indicate a 2-cm accuracy uniformly over the land and ocean regions, a consequence of the highly accurate, global and homogenous nature of the GRACE data.

Passive microwave sensors aboard satellites provide a capability of observing global SWE and have produced many SWE datasets. However, these datasets have significant errors in boreal forest regions and where snowpack is deep or wet. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites are measuring changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS), of which snow mass is the primary component in winter Arctic river basins. This paper shows SWE can be derived from GRACE TWS change in regions where the ground is not covered by snow in a summer month if accurate changes in below-ground water storage (including soil water and groundwater) can be provided by a land surface model. Based on gravity change, the GRACE-derived SWE estimates are not affected by the boreal forest canopy and are more accurate in deep snow regions than microwave retrievals.

abstract = {Full process description and distributed hydrological models are very useful tools in hydrology as they can be applied in different contexts and for a wide range of aims such as flood and drought forecasting, water management, and prediction of impact on the hydrologic cycle due to natural and human-induced changes. Since they must mimic a variety of physical processes, they can be very complex and with a high degree of parameterization. This complexity can be increased by necessity of augmenting the number of observable state variables in order to improve model validation or to allow data assimilation. In this work a model, aiming at balancing the need to reproduce the physical processes with the practical goal of avoiding over-parameterization, is presented. The model is designed to be implemented in different contexts with a special focus on data-scarce environments, e.g. with no streamflow data. All the main hydrological phenomena are modelled in a distributed way. Mass and energy balance are solved explicitly. Land surface temperature (LST), which is particularly suited to being extensively observed and assimilated, is an explicit state variable. A performance evaluation, based on both traditional and satellite derived data, is presented with a specific reference to the application in an Italian catchment. The model has been firstly calibrated and validated following a standard approach based on streamflow data. The capability of the model in reproducing both the streamflow measurements and the land surface temperature from satellites has been investigated. The model has been then calibrated using satellite data and geomorphologic characteristics of the basin in order to test its application on a basin where standard hydrologic observations (e.g. streamflow data) are not available. The results have been compared with those obtained by the standard calibration strategy based on streamflow data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {Tree transpiration in the Amazon may enhance rainfall for downwind forests. Until now it has been unclear how this cascading effect plays out across the basin. Here, we calculate local forest transpiration and the subsequent trajectories of transpired water through the atmosphere in high spatial and temporal detail. We estimate that one-third of Amazon rainfall originates within its own basin, of which two-thirds has been transpired. Forests in the southern half of the basin contribute most to the stability of other forests in this way, whereas forests in the south-western Amazon are particularly dependent on transpired-water subsidies. These forest-rainfall cascades buffer the effects of drought and reveal a mechanism by which deforestation can compromise the resilience of the Amazon forest system in the face of future climatic extremes.},

abstract = {In situ soil moisture data from 122 stations across the United States are used to evaluate the impact of a new bare ground evaporation formulation at ECMWF. In November 2010, the bare ground evaporation used in ECMWF's operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) was enhanced by adopting a lower stress threshold than for the vegetation, allowing a higher evaporation. It results in more realistic soil moisture values when compared to in situ data, particularly over dry areas. Use was made of the operational IFS and offline experiments for the evaluation. The latter are based on a fixed version of the IFS and make it possible to assess the impact of a single modification, while the operational analysis is based on a continuous effort to improve the analysis and modelling systems, resulting in frequent updates (a few times a year). Considering the field sites with a fraction of bare ground greater than 0.2, the root mean square difference (RMSD) of soil moisture is shown to decrease from 0.118 m3 m-3 to 0.087 m3 m-3 when using the new formulation in offline experiments, and from 0.110 m3 m-3 to 0.088 m3 m-3 in operations. It also improves correlations. Additionally, the impact of the new formulation on the terrestrial microwave emission at a global scale is investigated. Realistic and dynamically consistent fields of brightness temperature as a function of the land surface conditions are required for the assimilation of the SMOS data. Brightness temperature simulated from surface fields from two offline experiments with the Community Microwave Emission Modelling (CMEM) platform present monthly mean differences up to 7 K. Offline experiments with the new formulation present drier soil moisture, hence simulated brightness temperature with its surface fields are larger. They are also closer to SMOS remotely sensed brightness temperature. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {The mean annual recharge of Al-Khazir Gomal Basin was estimated as a basis for decision makers regarding the renewability and sustainability of groundwater. For this purpose, two approaches were used: hydrograph analysis and water table fluctuation (WTF). The long-term mean daily stream-flow records of Al-Khazir River (1969-1981) were used to estimate groundwater discharge by base-flow hydrograph separation and displacement recession curve methods. Four base-flow separation methods were used; one is the graphical separation method, and three are automated separation methods included in the web-based Hydrograph Analysis Tool. The annual recharge estimated by WTF was 111.6mm/y, and the average annual recharge estimated by the four base-flow separation methods was 125.8mm/y. Estimating recharge by the water table fluctuation method does not incorporate spatial variability contained in the whole watershed, because the specific yield did not represent the entire basin. However, the hydrograph analysis method can give a comprehensive estimation of the net integrated recharge for the entire watershed, which includes different recharge mechanisms. The displacement recession curve method deviates a lot (>30mm/y) from the other methods, which indicates that this method may not be suitable to apply in such large watersheds. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {An atmospheric general circulation model simulation for 1948-97 of the water budgets for the MacKenzie, Mississippi, and Amazon River basins is presented. In addition to the water budget, passive tracers are included to identify the geographic sources of water for the basins, and the analysis focuses on the mechanisms contributing to precipitation recycling in each basin. While each basin's precipitation recycling has a strong dependency on evaporation during the mean annual cycle, the interannual variability of the recycling shows important relationships with the atmospheric circulation. The MacKenzie River basin recycling has only a weak interannual correspondence with evaporation, where the variations in zonal moisture transport from the Pacific Ocean can affect the basin water cycle. On the other hand, the Mississippi River basin precipitation and recycling have strong interannual correlation on evaporation. The evaporation is related to the moist and shallow planetary boundary layer that provides moisture for convection at the cloud base. At global scales, high precipitation recycling is also found to be partly correlated to warm SSTs in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The Amazon River basin evaporation exhibits small interannual variations, so the interannual variations of precipitation recycling are related to atmospheric moisture transport from the tropical South Atlantic Ocean. Increasing SSTs over the 50-yr period are causing increased easterly transport across the basin. As moisture transport increases, the Amazon precipitation recycling decreases (without real-time varying vegetation changes). In addition, precipitation recycling from a bulk diagnostic method is compared to the passive tracer method used in the analysis. While the mean values of the different recycling methods are different, the interannual variations are comparable between each method. The methods also exhibit similar relationships to the terms of the basin-scale water budgets. {\textcopyright}2006 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Satellite radar altimetry has the ability to monitor variations in surface water height (stage) for large wetlands, rivers, and associated floodplains. A clear advantage is the provision of data where traditional gauges are absent. As part of an international program, a complete altimetric analysis of the Amazon Basin is being undertaken. Here, an updated and more rigorous evaluation of the TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) data set is presented for the first ∼7.5 years of the mission. With an initial study group of 230 targets, height variability at many ungauged locations can be observed for 30-50%, the range reflecting the clarity of the variations in lieu of instrument limitations. An assessment of the instrument performance confirms that the minimum river width attainable is ∼1 km in the presence of some inundated floodplain. This constraint does allow observation of the main stem (Solim{\~{o}}es/Amazon) and the larger tributaries, but rugged terrain in the vicinity of the target additionally places severe limitations on data retrieval. First-order validation exercises with the deduced 1992-1999 time series of stage fluctuations reveal accuracies ranging from tens of centimeters to several meters (mean ∼1.1 m rms). Altimetric water levels in the Solim{\~{o}}es and Amazon are particularly well defined with amplitudes <13 m and variations in peak-level timing from May to July. The water-surface gradient of the main stem is found to vary both spatially and temporally, with values ranging from 1.5 cm/km downstream to 4.0 cm/km for more upstream reaches. In agreement with ground-based estimates, the seasonal variability of the gradients reveals that the hysteresis characteristic of the flood wave varies along the main stem and the derived altimetric velocity of this flood wave is estimated to be ∼0.35 m/s. Overall, the altimetric results demonstrate that the T/P mission is successfully monitoring the transient flood waves of this continental-scale river basin.

abstract = {The rainfall characteristics over the Brazilian Amazon were analysed using 3 yr of 3 h data from 24 rain gauges. During this period, areas in the eastern sector experienced up to 22 % of rainy hours, while those in the southern sector recorded up to 7 %. In the northern Amazon, rain tends to occur during the night, while in southern, central and central-western Amazon it occurs mainly in the afternoon. In contrast, over the eastern Amazon, rain occurs late at night and early in the morning. Harmonic analysis revealed an increase in the phase of the first harmonic phase from eastern towards central Amazon, suggesting that the rain propagates in that direction. The amplitude of the first and second harmonics revealed the existence of a relatively dry area inland about 500 km from the Atlantic coast. This area seems to be the limit for the inland penetration of systems originating at the coast. The phase of the first harmonic revealed small differences between the diurnal cycles of rainfall during the wet and dry seasons, suggesting that there is no difference between low-level circulations in either season. {\textcopyright}Inter-Research 2003.},

abstract = {A multispectral approach is used to optimize the identification of raining clouds located at a given altitude estimated from the cloud-top temperature. The approach combines information from five channels on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES): visible (0.65 ␮m), near infrared (3.9 ␮m), water vapor (6.7 ␮m), and window channels (11 and 12 ␮m). The screening of nonraining clouds includes the use of spatial gradient of cloud-top temperature for cirrus clouds (this screening is applied at all times) and the effective radius of cloud-top particles derived from the measurements at 3.9 ␮m during daytime. During nighttime, only clouds colder than 230 K are considered for the screening; during daytime, all clouds having a visible reflectance greater than 0.40 are considered for the screening, and a threshold of 15 ␮m in droplet effective radius is used as a low boundary of raining clouds. A GOES rain rate for each indicated raining cloud group referenced by its cloud-top temperature is obtained by the product of probability of rain (P b) and mean rain rate (RR mean) and is adjusted by a moisture factor that is designed to modulate the evaporation effects on rain below cloud base for different moisture environments. The calibration of the algorithm for constants P b and RR mean is obtained using col-located instantaneous satellite and radar data and hourly gauge-adjusted radar products collected during 17 days in June and July 1998. A comparison of the combined visible and a temperature threshold of 230 K (e.g., previous infrared/visible algorithms) with the combined visible and a threshold of 15 ␮m demonstrates that the latter improves the detection of rain from warm clouds without lowering the skill of the algorithm. The quantitative validation shows that the algorithm performs well at daily and monthly scales. At monthly scales, a comparison with GOES Precipitation Index (GPI) shows that GOES Multispectral Rainfall Algo-rithm's performance against gauges is much better for September and October 1999.},

abstract = {An analysis of the Amazon basin hydrologic cycle has been carried out using the NASA/Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-1) atmospheric reanalysis, observed rainfall of Xie and Arkin [1996], and historical Amazon River discharge. Over a seasonal cycle the precipitation is found to vary by 5 mm d-1, and the runoff is found to vary by 2 mm d-1, while the evaporation largely remains constant. On interannual timescales the hydrologic variability both in the atmosphere and at the land surface is found to be closely related to El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The correlation between the Southern Oscillation Index and Xie and Arkin precipitation is 0.8 for the period 1985-1993 and 0.56 for the period 1979-1996. The precipitation lags behind the Southern Oscillation Index by 3-4 months while the Amazon River discharge lags behind the precipitation by another 3 months. The lagged relationship suggests interesting dynamic mechanisms. The reanalysis moisture convergence and observed discharge are used to diagnose basin average soil water storage. The year to year variation in the annual mean soil water storage is ∼200 mm, comparable to the change within a climatological seasonal cycle. In one case, the basin soil water storage increases by 462 mm from September 1987 to March 1989, suggesting the remarkable ability of the tropical rain forest environment to store and take up water.

abstract = {An innovative remote sensing approach that combines land-use change and water quality information is proposed in order to investigate if Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) area extension is associated with water siltation in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River Basin (Brazil), containing the largest small-scale gold mining district in the world. Taking advantage of a 40-year period of the multi-satellite imagery archive, the objective of this paper is to build a normalized time-series in order to evaluate the influence of temporal mining expansion on the water siltation data (TSS, Total Suspended Solids concentration) derived from previous research. The methodological approach was set to deliver a full characterization of the ASGM expansion from its initial stages in the early 1970s to the present. First, based on IRS/LISSIII images acquired in 2012, the historical Landsat image database (1973–2001) was corrected for radiometric and atmospheric effects using dark vegetation as reference to create a normalized time-series. Next, a complete update of the mining areas distribution in 2012 derived from the TerraClass Project (an official land-use classification for the Brazilian Amazon) was conducted having IRS/LISSIII as the base map with the support of auxiliary data and vector editing. Once the ASGM in 2012 was quantified (261.7 km2) and validated with photos, a reverse classification of ASGM in 2001 (171.7 km2), 1993 (166.3 km2), 1984 (47.5 km2), and 1973 (15.4 km2) with the use of Landsat archives was applied. This procedure relies on the assumption that ASGM changes in the land cover are severe and remain detectable from satellite sensors for decades. The mining expansion area over time was then combined with the (TSS) data retrieved from the same atmospherically corrected satellite imagery based on the literature. In terms of gold mining expansion and water siltation effects, four main periods of ASGM activities were identified in the study area: (i) 1958–1977, first occurrence of mining activities and low water impacts; (ii) 1978–1993, introduction of low-budget mechanization associated with very high gold prices resulting in large mining area expansion and high water siltation levels; (iii) 1994–2003, general recession of ASGM activities and exhaustion of easy-access gold deposits, resulting in decreased TSS; (iv) 2004 to present, intensification of ASGM encouraged by high gold prices, resulting in an increase of TSS.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of the ORCHIDEE land surface model to simulate streamflows over each sub-basin of the Amazon River basin. For this purpose, simulations are performed with a routing module including the influence of floodplains and swamps on river discharge and validated against on-site hydrological measurements collected within the HYBAM observatory over the 1980-2000 period. When forced by the NCC global meteorological dataset, the initial version of ORCHIDEE shows discrepancies with ORE HYBAM measurements with underestimation by 15% of the annual mean streamflow at {\'{O}}bidos hydrological station. Consequently, several improvements are incrementally added to the initial simulation in order to reduce those discrepancies. First, values of NCC precipitation are substituted by ORE HYBAM daily in-situ rainfall observations from the meteorological services of Amazonian countries, interpolated over the basin. It highly improves the simulated streamflow over the northern and western parts of the basin, whereas streamflow over southern regions becomes overestimated, probably due to the extension of rainy spots that may be exaggerated by our interpolation method, or to an underestimation of simulated evapotranspiration when compared to flux tower measurements. Second, the initial map of maximal fractions of floodplains and swamps which largely underestimates floodplains areas over the main stem of the Amazon River and over the region of Llanos de Moxos in Bolivia, is substituted by a new one with a better agreement with different estimates over the basin. Simulated monthly water height is consequently better represented in ORCHIDEE when compared to Topex/Poseidon measurements over the main stem of the Amazon. Finally, a calibration of the time constant of the floodplain reservoir is performed to adjust the mean simulated seasonal peak flow at {\'{O}}bidos in agreement with the observations.},

abstract = {Simultaneous rainfall analyses using Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave measurements and thermal infrared measurements from Meteosat are presented for two storms over northern Italy that caused damaging floods. Upwelling brightness temperatures over precipitating clouds in the mm-cm spectrum are directly associated with precipitation microphysics throughout the cloud column down into the rain layer. In contrast, brightness temperatures in the thermal infrared window, which arise from emission near cloud top, are not directly responsive to precipitation processes. However, because of the diffraction-limited nature of passive microwave detectors, microwave radiometer ground footprints are considerably larger than those characteristic of infrared sensors, even those flown at geosynchronous altitude. Furthermore, passive microwave radiometers are flown on low-earth orbiters, which produce less than ideal sampling rates, whereas optical-infrared radiometers flown on geosynchronous orbiters produce high frequency sampling concomitant with precipitation time scales. In this study, we investigate how these two types of measuring systems could be used in a complementary fashion to improve rainfall estimation. A physically based microwave algorithm is used to estimate rainfall with SSM/I measurements, whereas a two-threshold statistical technique is used for corresponding estimates from Meteosat. Results suggest that an infrared-based analysis of rainfall derived from half-hourly geosynchronous images can be improved with a calibration-transfer approach using a microwave algorithm sensitive to vertical cloud structure.},

abstract = {Due to progressive erosion of the new Urucurituba Channel, the Amazon River has recently captured almost all discharge from the lower Araguari River (Amap{\'{a}}-AP, Brazil), which previously flowed directly to the Atlantic Ocean. These recent geomorphological changes have caused strong impacts on the landscape and hydrodynamic patterns near the Araguari River mouth, especially the alteration of the riverine drainage system and its water quality. Landsat images were used to assess the estuarine landscape morphodynamic, particularly the expansion of the Urucurituba Channel, 80 km from the Araguari River mouth, chronicling its connection to the Amazon River. The results suggest that the Urucurituba developed by headward migration across the Amazon delta; this is perhaps the first observation of estuarine distributary network development by headward channel erosion. The rate of Urucurituba Channel width increase has been ≈ 5 m/month since 2011, increasing drainage capacity of the channel. We also collected in situ hydrodynamic measurements and analyzed 17 water quality parameters. Having 2011 as baseline, the flowrate of Araguari River has been diverted by up to 98% through Urucurituba Channel, with substantial changes in net discharge recorded at 3 monitoring stations. Statistically significant differences in water quality (p < 0.05) were observed between 2011 and 2015, associated with the change in the flow pattern. Estuarine salinity and solids concentrations have increased. Overall, we demonstrate changes in landscape, hydrodynamics and water quality of the lower Araguari River.},

abstract = {Freshwater discharge along continental margins is a key Earth system variable that is not well monitored globally. Here we propose a method for estimating monthly river basin outflows based on the use of new GRACE satellite estimates of terrestrial water storage changes in a coupled land-atmosphere. water balance. Using GRACE land water storage changes (which include changes in groundwater storage) in the water balance method results in more holistic estimates of basin discharge, which we call total basin discharge, that include not only streamflow, but the net of surface, groundwater and tidal inflows and outflows. The method was tested on the Amazon and Mississippi river basins, and could ultimately be applied to the major drainage regions and river basins of the globe. Estimated Amazon total basin discharge was well correlated with observed streamflow, but with a phase lag and underestimation of low flows. Estimated total basin discharge in the Mississippi river basin had a greater annual amplitude than observed streamflow, but showed good temporal covariance. Results for both basins highlight important differences between estimated total basin discharge and observed streamflow, at least part of which can be attributed to groundwater storage changes. Atmospheric moisture data and methods of GRACE data processing also contributed to the differences. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Changes in weather and land use are transforming the spatial and temporal characteristics of fire regimes in Amazonia, with important effects on the functioning of dense (i.e., closed-canopy), open-canopy, and transitional forests across the Basin. To quantify, document, and describe the characteristics and recent changes in forest fire regimes, we sampled 6 million ha of these three representative forests of the eastern and southern edges of the Amazon using 24 years (1983-2007) of satellite-derived annual forest fire scar maps and 16 years of monthly hot pixel information (1992-2007). Our results reveal that changes in forest fire regime properties differentially affected these three forest types in terms of area burned and fire scar size, frequency, and seasonality. During the study period, forest fires burned 15% (0.3 million ha), 44% (1 million ha), and 46% (0.6 million ha) of dense, open, and transitional forests, respectively. Total forest area burned and fire scar size tended to increase over time (even in years of average rainfall in open canopy and transitional forests). In dense forests, most of the temporal variability in fire regime properties was linked to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related droughts. Compared with dense forests, transitional and open forests experienced fires twice as frequently, with at least 20% of these forests' areas burning two or more times during the 24-year study period. Open and transitional forests also experienced higher deforestation rates than dense forests. During drier years, the end of the dry season was delayed by about a month, which resulted in larger burn scars and increases in overall area burned later in the season. These observations suggest that climate-mediated forest flammability is enhanced by landscape fragmentation caused by deforestation, as observed for open and transitional forests in the Eastern portion of the Amazon Basin.},

This study focuses on the terrestrial water cycle and presents methodologies to obtain a coherent dataset of four water cycle key components: precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and terrestrial water storage. Various innovative “integration” methodologies are introduced: simple weighting (SW), constrained linear (CL), optimal interpolation (OI), and neural networks (NN). The term “integration” will be used here, not “assimilation,” as no model will be included in the data fusion process. A simple postprocessing filtering (PF) step can be used to impose the water cycle budget closure after the integration method. It is shown that this constraint actually improves the estimation of the water cycle components. The integration techniques are tested using real observation da...},

abstract = {Global estimates of river dynamics are needed in order to manage water resources, mainly in developing countries where in-situ observation is limited. Remote sensors such as nadir altimeters can complement ground data. Current altimeters miss however a large number of continental surface water bodies. This issue will be largely resolved by the future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, thanks to its wide swath altimeter. SWOT will provide almost globally two-dimensional water elevation maps for rivers over 100 m wide and water bodies over 250 m × 250 m. During this research, we investigated the potential of SWOT to correct hydrological models on a global/continental scale, through data assimilation. For this purpose, an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE), also known as “twin experiment”, has been implemented. Model forcings and parameters were perturbed to jointly achieve global hydrological models (GHMs) uncertainties, which is the expected scenario in which the SWOT community will mainly evaluate the future SWOT data. SWOT-like observations of water surface elevation (WSE), flooded water extent (FWE), and/or SWOT derived discharge (Q) were used to correct modelled Q, WSE and FWE from a large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic model (MGB – portuguese acronym of “Modelo de Grandes Bacias”), using a Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The results indicate that SWOT products could largely improve hydrological simulations on a global and continental scale. SWOT-like discharge can reduce $\sim$40% of model errors in daily discharge. Furthermore, when anomalies of the WSE DA approach were implemented, the error reduction was even greater for all state variables compared to the absolute WSE DA, achieving average error reduction values of about $\sim$30% compared to $\sim$24%. Finally, the simultaneous DA of all the SWOT-like variables together reduces errors from $\sim$14% to $\sim$22% compared to the average of assimilating only one variable.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the spatial and temporal variability of winter droughts in a semi-arid geographic gradient in Northeast Spain, from the Pyrenees in the north to the Mediterranean coastland in the south. Droughts that occurred between 1952 and 1999 were analysed by means of the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The influence of the weather-type frequency and of the general North Atlantic atmospheric circulation patterns was analysed. The results indicate that winter droughts show an important spatial variability in the study area, differentiating three well-defined patterns. These correspond to the Pyrenees, the centre of the Ebro Valley, and the Mediterranean coastland. General negative trends in winter SPI have been found, which are indicative of the increase in winter drought conditions in the study area. Nevertheless, important spatial differences have also been recorded. Dominant north–south gradients in the influence of weather types are shown. Moreover, the negative trends in winter-SPI values agree with the negative trend in the frequency of the weather types prone to cause precipitation, such as the C, SW and W weather types and the increase in the frequency of A weather types. Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean coastland, the positive trend in SPI values agrees with the increase in the frequency of weather types of the east (E, SE), which are prone to cause precipitation in this area. Interannual variations in the frequency of the different weather types have been highly determined by different general atmospheric circulation patterns, mainly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Nevertheless, the correlation between the time series of weather-type frequency and the winter SPI is higher than that found between the SPI and the NAO. Thus, although the interannual NAO variability explains a high percentage of the interannual differences in the frequency of different weather types, it is not sufficient to explain the spatial and temporal variability of droughts, which respond better to atmospheric variability at more detailed (synoptic) spatial scales.},

abstract = {Soil moisture is a key participant in land-atmosphere interactions and an important determinant of terrestrial climate. In regions where the water table is shallow, soil moisture is coupled to the water table. This paper is the first of a two-part study to quantify this coupling and explore its implications in the context of climate modeling. We examine the observed water table depth in the lower 48 states of the United States in search of salient spatial and temporal features that are relevant to climate dynamics. As a means to interpolate and synthesize the scattered observations, we use a simple two-dimensional groundwater flow model to construct an equilibrium water table as a result of long-term climatic and geologic forcing. Model simulations suggest that the water table depth exhibits spatial organization at watershed, regional, and continental scales, which may have implications for the spatial organization of soil moisture at similar scales. The observations suggest that water table depth varies at diurnal, event, seasonal, and interannual scales, which may have implications for soil moisture memory at these scales.

abstract = {The GRACE mission is designed to monitor mass flux on the Earth's surface at one month and high spatial resolution through the estimation of monthly gravity fields. Although this approach has been largely successful, information at submonthly time scales can be lost or even aliased through the estimation of static monthly parameters. Through an analysis of the GRACE data residuals, we show that the fundamental temporal and spatial resolution of the GRACE data is 10 days and 400 km. We present an approach similar in concept to altimetric methods that recovers submonthly mass flux at a high spatial resolution. Using 4° × 4° blocks at 10-day intervals, we estimate the mass of surplus or deficit water over a 52° × 60° grid centered on the Amazon basin for July 2003. We demonstrate that the recovered signals are coherent and correlate well with the expected hydrological signal. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The evaluated TMPA products are TRMM-3B42 and TRMM-3B42RT. The first of the two validations region is located over the Ethiopian highlands in the Horn of Africa. The second is located over the highlands of Columbia in South America. Both sites are characterized by a very complex terrain. Relatively dense station networks over the two sites are used to validate the satellite products. The correlation coefficients between the reference gauge data and the satellite products were found to be low. Besides, the products underestimate both the occurrence and amount of rainfall over both validation sites. These were attributed, at least partly, to orographic warm rain process over the two regions. The performance over Colombia was better compared to that for Ethiopia. And CMORPH has exhibited better performance as compared to the two TRMM products. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Version 1.0 of HydroATLAS offers data for 56 variables, partitioned into 281 individual attributes and organized in six categories: hydrology; physiography; climate; land cover & use; soils & geology; and anthropogenic influences. HydroATLAS derives the hydro-environmental characteristics by aggregating and reformatting original data from well-established global digital maps, and by accumulating them along the drainage network from headwaters to ocean outlets. The attributes are linked to hierarchically nested sub-basins at multiple scales, as well as to individual river reaches, both extracted from the global HydroSHEDS database at 15 arc-second ($\sim$500 m) resolution. The sub-basin and river reach information is offered in two companion datasets: BasinATLAS and RiverATLAS. The standardized format of HydroATLAS ensures easy applicability while the inherent topological information supports basic network functionality such as identifying up- and downstream connections. HydroATLAS is fully compatible with other products of the overarching HydroSHEDS project enabling versatile hydro-ecological assessments for a broad user community.

abstract = {The validation of geophysical data sets (e.g. derived from models, exploration techniques or remote sensing) presents a formidable challenge as all products are inherently different and subject to errors. The collocation technique permits the retrieval of the error variances of different data sources without the need to specify one data set as a reference. In addition calibration constants can be determined to account for biases and different dynamic ranges. The method is frequently applied to the study and comparison of remote sensing, in-situ and modelled data, particularly in hydrology and oceanography. Previous studies have almost exclusively focussed on the validation of three data sources; in this paper it is shown how the technique generalizes to an arbitrary number of data sets. It turns out that only parts of the covariance structure can be resolved by the col-location technique, thus emphasizing the necessity of expert knowledge for the correct validation of geophysical products. Furthermore the bias and error variance of the estimators are derived with particular emphasis on the assumptions necessary for establishing those characteristics. Important properties of the method, such as the structural deficiencies, dependence of the accuracy on the number of measurements and the impact of violated assumptions, are illustrated by application to simulated data.},

In the current study we present the longest synthetic aperture radar-based time series of flood and inundation information derived for the Mekong Delta that has been analyzed for this region so far. We employed overall 60 Envisat ASAR Wide Swath Mode data sets at a spatial resolution of 150 meters acquired during the years 2007{\textendash}2011 to facilitate a thorough understanding of the flood regime in the Mekong Delta. The Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam comprises 13 provinces and is home to 18 million inhabitants. Extreme dry seasons from late December to May and wet seasons from June to December characterize people{\textquoteright}s rural life. In this study, we show which areas of the delta are frequently affected by floods and which regions remain dry all year round. Furthermore, we present which areas are flooded at which frequency and elucidate the patterns of flood progression over the course of the rainy season. In this context, we also examine the impact of dykes on floodwater emergence and assess the relationship between retrieved flood occurrence patterns and land use. In addition, the advantages and shortcomings of ENVISAT ASAR-WSM based flood mapping are discussed. The results contribute to a comprehensive understanding of Mekong Delta flood dynamics in an environment where the flow regime is influenced by the Mekong River, overland water-flow, anthropogenic floodwater control, as well as the tides.},

abstract = {<p>Abstract. We used a Lagrangian model (FLEXPART) together with the 1979–2012 ERA-Interim reanalysis data to investigate the role of the moisture in the Amazon Basin in the regional hydrological budget over the course of the year. FLEXPART computes budgets of evaporation minus precipitation by calculating changes in the specific humidity along forward and backward trajectories. The tropical Atlantic is the most important remote moisture source for the Amazon Basin. The tropical North Atlantic (NA) mainly contributed during the austral summer, while the contribution of the tropical South Atlantic (SA) prevailed for the remainder of the year. At the same time, the moisture contribution from the Amazon Basin itself is mainly for moisture supplying the southeastern South America. The 33-year temporal domain allowed the investigation of some aspects of the interannual variability of the moisture transport over the basin, such as the role of the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) on the hydrological budget. During the peak of the Amazonian rainy season (from February to May, FMAM) the AMM is associated more with the interannual variations in the contribution from the tropical Atlantic sources, while the transport from the basin towards the subtropics responds more to the ENSO variability. The moisture contribution prevailed from the SA (NA) region in the years dominated by El Ni{\~{n}}o/positive AMM (La Ni{\~{n}}a/negative AMM) conditions. The transport from the Amazon towards the subtropics increased (reduced) during El Ni{\~{n}}o (La Ni{\~{n}}a) years.</p>},

abstract = {Arctic field studies have indicated that the air tem-perature, soil moisture and vegetation at a site influence the quantity of snow accumulated, and that snow accumulation can alter growing-season soil moisture and vegetation. Cli-mate change is predicted to bring about warmer air tempera-tures, greater snow accumulation and northward movements of the shrub and tree lines. Understanding the responses of northern environments to changes in snow and growing-season land surface characteristics requires: (1) insights into the present-day linkages between snow and growing-season land surface characteristics; and (2) the ability to continue to monitor these associations over time across the vast pan-Arctic. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the pan-Arctic (north of 60 • N) linkages between two tem-porally distinct data products created from AMSR-E satel-lite passive microwave observations: GlobSnow snow wa-ter equivalent (SWE), and NTSG growing-season AMSR-E Land Parameters (air temperature, soil moisture and veg-etation transmissivity). Due to the complex and intercon-nected nature of processes determining snow and growing-season land surface characteristics, these associations were analyzed using the modern nonparametric technique of al-ternating conditional expectations (ACE), as this approach does not impose a predefined analytic form. Findings indi-cate that regions with lower vegetation transmissivity (more biomass) at the start and end of the growing season tend to accumulate less snow at the start and end of the snow sea-son, possibly due to interception and sublimation. Warmer air temperatures at the start and end of the growing season were associated with diminished snow accumulation at the start and end of the snow season. High latitude sites with warmer mean annual growing-season temperatures tended to accu-mulate more snow, probably due to the greater availability of water vapor for snow season precipitation at warmer loca-tions. Regions with drier soils preceding snow onset tended to accumulate greater quantities of snow, likely because drier soils freeze faster and more thoroughly than wetter soils. Un-derstanding and continuing to monitor these linkages at the regional scale using the ACE approach can allow insights to be gained into the complex response of Arctic ecosystems to climate-driven shifts in air temperature, vegetation, soil moisture and snow accumulation.},

abstract = {Quantitative information on the spatial and temporal error structures in large-scale (regional or global) precipitation datasets is essential for hydrologic and climatic studies. A powerful tool to quantify error structures in large-scale datasets is triple collocation. In this paper, triple collocation is used to determine the spatial and temporal error characteristics of three precipitation datasets over Europe-that is, the precipitationproperties visible/near infrared (PP-VNIR) retrievals from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instrument on board Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), weather radar observations from the European integrated weather radar system, and gridded rain gauge observations from the datasets of the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D) project. For these datasets the spatial and temporal error characteristics are evaluated and their performance is discussed. Finally, weather radar and PP-VNIR retrievals are used to evaluate the diurnal cycles of precipitation occurrence and intensity during daylight hours for different European climate regions. The results suggest that the triple collocation method provides realistic error estimates. The spatial and temporal error structures agree with the findings of earlier studies and reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the datasets, such as inhomogeneity of weather radar practices across Europe, the effect of sampling density in the gridded rain gauge dataset, and the sensitivity to retrieval assumptions in the PP-VNIR dataset. This study can help us in developing satisfactory strategies for combining various precipitation datasets-for example, for improved monitoring of diurnal variations or for detecting temporal trends in precipitation. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This study first focuses on comprehensive evaluating three widely used satellite precipitation products (TMPA 3B42V6, TMPA 3B42RT, and CMORPH) with a dense rain gauge network in the Mishui basin (9972km 2) in South China and then optimally merge their simulated hydrologic flows with the semi-distributed Xinanjiang model using the Bayesian model averaging method. The initial satellite precipitation data comparisons show that the reanalyzed 3B42V6, with a bias of -4.54%, matched best with the rain gauge observations, while the two near real-time satellite datasets (3B42RT and CMORPH) largely underestimated precipitation by 42.72% and 40.81% respectively. With the model parameters first benchmarked by the rain gauge data, the behavior of the streamflow simulation from the 3B42V6 was also the most optimal amongst the three products, while the two near real-time satellite datasets produced deteriorated biases and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSCEs). Still, when the model parameters were recalibrated by each individual satellite data, the performance of the streamflow simulations from the two near real-time satellite products were significantly improved, thus demonstrating the need for specific calibrations of the hydrological models for the near real-time satellite inputs. Moreover, when optimally merged with respect to the streamflows forced by the two near real-time satellite precipitation products and all the three satellite precipitation products using the Bayesian model averaging method, the resulted streamflow series further improved and became more robust. In summary, the three current state-of-the-art satellite precipitation products have demonstrated potential in hydrological research and applications. The benchmarking, recalibration, and optimal merging schemes for streamflow simulation at a basin scale described in the present work will hopefully be a reference for future utilizations of satellite precipitation products in global and regional hydrological applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The monitoring of the world's climate using conventional means is well established, incorporating numerous historical data sets to ensure a long-term record. Parameters such as temperature have been quite accurately recorded over the last 200 years or so, but other parameters such as rainfall are less well recorded. This paper introduces satellite rainfall climatology and why it is important, not only from the longer term study of rainfall, but also for the future monitoring and estimation of rainfall. A summary of the range of satellites and their instruments is reviewed to provide a background to the techniques. These are discussed and their relative merits explored. Finally, examples of the techniques are shown, illustrating the applications to which the satellite-derived data sets may be put. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This study reports the first assessment of the compounding effects of land-use change and greenhouse gas warming effects on our understanding of projections of future climate. An AGCM simulation of the potential impacts of tropical deforestation and greenhouse warming on climate, employing a version of NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM1-Oz), is presented. The joint impacts of tropical deforestation and greenhouse warming are assessed by an experiment in which removal of tropical rainforests is imposed into a greenhouse-warmed climate. Results show that the joint climate changes over tropical rainforest regions comprise large reductions in surface evapotranspiration (by about -180 mm yr-1) and precipitation (by about -312 mm yr-1) over the Amazon Basin, along with an increase of surface temperature by +3.0 K. Over Southeast Asia, similar but weaker changes are found in this study. Precipitation is decreased by -172 mm yr-1, together with the surface warming of 2.1 K. Over tropical Africa, changes in regional climate is much weaker and with some different features, such as the increase of precipitation by 25 mm yr-1. Energy budget analyses demonstrates that the large increase of surface temperature in the joint experiment is not solely produced by the increase of CO2 concentration, but is a joint effect of the reduction of surface evaporation (due to deforestation) and the increase of downward atmospheric longwave radiation (due to the doubling of CO2 concentration). Furthermore, impacts of tropical deforestation on the greenhouse-warmed climate are estimated by comparing a pair of tropical deforestation simulations. It is found that in CCM1-Oz, deforestation has very similar impacts on greenhouse-warmed regional climates as on current climates over tropical rainforest regions. The extra-tropical climatic response to tropical deforestation is identified in both sets of tropical deforestation experiments. Statistically significant responses are seen in the large-scale atmospheric circulation such as changes in the velocity potential and vertically integrated kinetic and potential energy fields. Wave propagation patterns are identified in the large-scale circulation anomalies, which provides a mechanism for interpreting the model responses in the extra-tropics. In addition, this study suggests that land-use change such as tropical deforestation may affect projections of future climate.},

abstract = {This study investigates the applicability of Satellite Precipitation Products (SPPs) in near real-time for the simulation of sub-daily runoff in the Vilcanota River basin, located in the southeastern Andes of Peru. The data from rain gauge stations are used to evaluate the quality of Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM–Early (IMERG-E), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation–Near Real-Time (GSMaP-NRT), Climate Prediction Center Morphing Method (CMORPH), and HydroEstimator (HE) at the pixel-station level; and these SPPs are used as meteorological inputs for the hourly hydrological modeling. The GR4H model is calibrated with the hydrometric station of the longest record, and model simulations are also verified at one station upstream and two stations downstream of the calibration point. Comparing the sub-daily precipitation data observed, the results show that the IMERG-E product generally presents higher quality, followed by GSMaP-NRT, CMORPH, and HE. Although the SPPs present positive and negative biases, ranging from mild to moderate, they do represent the diurnal and seasonal variability of the hourly precipitation in the study area. In terms of the average of Kling-Gupta metric (KGE), the GR4H_GSMaP-NRT' yielded the best representation of hourly discharges (0.686), followed by GR4H_IMERG-E' (0.623), GR4H_Ensemble-Mean (0.617) and GR4H_CMORPH' (0.606), and GR4H_HE' (0.516). Finally, the SPPs showed a high potential for monitoring floods in the Vilcanota basin in near real-time at the operational level. The results obtained in this research are very useful for implementing flood early warning systems in the Vilcanota basin and will allow the monitoring and short-term hydrological forecasting of floods by the Peruvian National Weather and Hydrological Service.},

abstract = {In this work we document and analyze the hydrological annual cycles characterized by a rapid transition between low and high flows in the Amazonas River (Peruvian Amazon) and we show how these events, which may impact vulnerable riverside residents, are related to regional climate variability. Our analysis is based on comprehensive discharge, rainfall and average suspended sediment data sets. Particular attention is paid to the 2010–11 hydrological year, when an unprecedented abrupt transition from the extreme September 2010 drought (8300 m 3 s −1 ) to one of the four highest discharges in April 2011 (49 500 m 3 s −1 ) was recorded at Tamshiyacu (Amazonas River). This unusual transition is also observed in average suspended sediments. Years with a rapid increase in discharge are characterized by negative sea surface temperature anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific during austral summer, corresponding to a La Ni{\~{n}}a-like mode. It originates a geopotential height wave train over the subtropical South Pacific and southeastern South America, with a negative anomaly along the southern Amazon and the southeastern South Atlantic convergence zone region. As a consequence, the monsoon flux is retained over the Amazon and a strong convergence of humidity occurs in the Peruvian Amazon basin, favoring high rainfall and discharge. These features are also reported during the 2010–11 austral summer, when an intense La Ni{\~{n}}a event characterized the equatorial Pacific.},

abstract = {Quantification of spatially and temporally resolved water flows and water storage variations for all land areas of the globe is required to assess water resources, water scarcity and flood hazards, and to understand the Earth system. This quantification is done with the help of global hydrological models (GHMs). What are the challenges and prospects in the development and application of GHMs? Seven important challenges are presented. (1) Data scarcity makes quantification of human water use difficult even though significant progress has been achieved in the last decade. (2) Uncertainty of meteorological input data strongly affects model outputs. (3) The reaction of vegetation to changing climate and CO2 concentrations is uncertain and not taken into account in most GHMs that serve to estimate climate change impacts. (4) Reasons for discrepant responses of GHMs to changing climate have yet to be identified. (5) More accurate estimates of monthly time series of water availability and use are needed to provide good indicators of water scarcity. (6) Integration of gradient-based groundwater modelling into GHMs is necessary for a better simulation of groundwater–surface water interactions and capillary rise. (7) Detection and attribution of human interference with freshwater systems by using GHMs are constrained by data of insufficient quality but also GHM uncertainty itself. Regarding prospects for progress, we propose to decrease the uncertainty of GHM output by making better use of in situ and remotely sensed observations of output variables such as river discharge or total water storage variations by multi-criteria validation, calibration or data assimilation. Finally, we present an initiative that works towards the vision of hyperresolution global hydrological modelling where GHM outputs would be provided at a 1-km resolution with reasonable accuracy.},

abstract = {An innovative remote sensing approach that combines land-use change and water quality information is proposed in order to investigate if Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) area extension is associated with water siltation in the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River Basin (Brazil), containing the largest small-scale gold mining district in the world. Taking advantage of a 40-year period of the multi-satellite imagery archive, the objective of this paper is to build a normalized time-series in order to evaluate the influence of temporal mining expansion on the water siltation data (TSS, Total Suspended Solids concentration) derived from previous research. The methodological approach was set to deliver a full characterization of the ASGM expansion from its initial stages in the early 1970s to the present. First, based on IRS/LISSIII images acquired in 2012, the historical Landsat image database (1973–2001) was corrected for radiometric and atmospheric effects using dark vegetation as reference to create a normalized time-series. Next, a complete update of the mining areas distribution in 2012 derived from the TerraClass Project (an official land-use classification for the Brazilian Amazon) was conducted having IRS/LISSIII as the base map with the support of auxiliary data and vector editing. Once the ASGM in 2012 was quantified (261.7 km2) and validated with photos, a reverse classification of ASGM in 2001 (171.7 km2), 1993 (166.3 km2), 1984 (47.5 km2), and 1973 (15.4 km2) with the use of Landsat archives was applied. This procedure relies on the assumption that ASGM changes in the land cover are severe and remain detectable from satellite sensors for decades. The mining expansion area over time was then combined with the (TSS) data retrieved from the same atmospherically corrected satellite imagery based on the literature. In terms of gold mining expansion and water siltation effects, four main periods of ASGM activities were identified in the study area: (i) 1958–1977, first occurrence of mining activities and low water impacts; (ii) 1978–1993, introduction of low-budget mechanization associated with very high gold prices resulting in large mining area expansion and high water siltation levels; (iii) 1994–2003, general recession of ASGM activities and exhaustion of easy-access gold deposits, resulting in decreased TSS; (iv) 2004 to present, intensification of ASGM encouraged by high gold prices, resulting in an increase of TSS.},

abstract = {River width is a fundamental parameter of river hydrodynamic simulations, but no global-scale river width database based on observed water bodies has yet been developed. Here we present a new algorithm that automatically calculates river width from satellite-based water masks and flow direction maps. The Global Width Database for Large Rivers (GWD-LR) is developed by applying the algorithm to the SRTM Water Body Database and the HydroSHEDS flow direction map. Both bank-to-bank river width and effective river width excluding islands are calculated for river channels between 60S and 60N. The effective river width of GWD-LR is compared with existing river width databases for the Congo and Mississippi Rivers. The effective river width of the GWD-LR is slightly narrower compared to the existing databases, but the relative difference is within ±20% for most river channels. As the river width of the GWD-LR is calculated along the river channels of the HydroSHEDS flow direction map, it is relatively straightforward to apply the GWD-LR to global and continental-scale river modeling. {\textcopyright} 2014.

Recent studies have demonstrated considerable resilience of Amazonian forests to moderate annual drought, but they also show that interactions between deforestation, fire and drought potentially lead to losses of carbon storage and changes in regional precipitation patterns and river discharge. Although the basin-wide impacts of land use and drought may not yet surpass the magnitude of natural variability of hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, there are some signs of a transition to a disturbance-dominated regime. These signs include changing energy and water cycles in the southern and eastern portions of the Amazon basin. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Triple collocation analysis (TCA) enables estimation of error variances for three or more products that retrieve or estimate the same geophysical variable using mutually independent methods. Several statistical assumptions regarding the statistical nature of errors (e.g., mutual independence and orthogonality with respect to the truth) are required for TCA estimates to be unbiased. Even though soil moisture studies commonly acknowledge that these assumptions are required for an unbiased TCA, no study has specifically investigated the degree to which errors in existing soil moisture datasets conform to these assumptions. Here these assumptions are evaluated both analytically and numerically over four extensively instrumented watershed sites using soil moisture products derived from active microwave remote sensing, passive microwave remote sensing, and a land surface model. Results demonstrate that nonorthogonal and error crosscovariance terms represent a significant fraction of the total variance of these products. However, the overall impact of error cross correlation on TCA is found to be significantly larger than the impact of nonorthogonal errors. Because of the impact of cross-correlated errors, TCA error estimates generally underestimate the true random error of soil moisture products. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) provides 8461 channels in the infrared spectrum. In current numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, it is not feasible to assimilate all channels and it is known that the information content between adjacent channels is redundant. This issue has been addressed in NWP centres by employing a channel selection strategy. The goal of this article is to add new channels to the existing IASI operational channel selection, aimed at improving the data assimilation in cloudy conditions and the simultaneous retrieval of cloud microphysical variables, specifically liquid and ice water contents. Cloudy profiles from the French convective-scale model Applications of Research to Operations at MEsoscale (AROME) are used in the study to focus on the retrieval of cloud variables over the Mediterranean region. Three channel selection methodologies were evaluated in this study: a statistical approach based on the degrees of freedom of the signal (DFS), a physical method based on the channel spectral sensitivity to the cloud variables and a random selection. To validate the new selections, an idealized framework is used with observing system simulation experiments (OSSE) in the context of one-dimensional variational retrievals. The current operational IASI selection has already been shown to provide good retrievals of cloud variables. However, all the different channel selections improve the results with small differences in the 1D-Var retrievals. Based on the physical and DFS methods, the final sets of 134 channels sensitive to cloud variables are proposed for future investigation in operational implementation. Additional tests on temperature and water-vapour retrieval results, air-mass dependence and cloud microphysical parametrization have also been conducted. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.},

@article{Brocca2014c,
abstract = {Measuring precipitation intensity is not straightforward; and overmany areas, ground observations are lacking and satellite observations are used to fill this gap. The most common way of retrieving rainfall is by addressing the problem “top-down” by inverting the atmospheric signals reflected or radiated by atmospheric hydrometeors. However, most applications are interested in how much water reaches the ground, a problem that is notoriously difficult to solve froma top-down perspective. In this study, a novel “bottom-up” approach is proposed that, by doing “hydrology backward," uses variations in soil moisture (SM) sensed by microwave satellite sensors to infer preceding rainfall amounts. In other words, the soil is used as a natural rain gauge. Three different satellite SM data sets from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), and the Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis are used to obtain three new daily global rainfall products. The “First Guess Daily” product of the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) is employed asmain benchmark in the validation period 2010-2011 for determining the continuous and categorical performance of the SM-derived rainfall products by considering the 5 day accumulated values. The real-time version of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis product, i.e., the TRMM-3B42RT, is adopted as a state-of-the-art satellite rainfall product. The SM-derived rainfall products show good Pearson correlation values (R) with the GPCC data set, mainly in areas where SM retrievals are found to be accurate. The global median R values (in the latitude band ±50°) are equal to 0.54, 0.28, and 0.31 for ASCAT-, AMSR-E-, and SMOS-derived products, respectively. For comparison, the median R for the TRMM-3B42RT product is equal to 0.53. Interestingly, the SM-derived products are found to outperform TRMM-3B42RT in terms of average global root-mean-square error statistics and in terms of detection of rainfall events. The regions for which the SM-derived products perform very well are Australia, Spain, South and North Africa, India, China, the Eastern part of South America, and the central part of the United States. The SM-derived products are found to estimate accurately the rainfall accumulated over a 5 day period, an aspect particularly important for their use for hydrological applications, and that address the difficulties of estimating light rainfall from TRMM-3B42RT.},

abstract = {Amazonian rainfall plays a critical role in the global climate system and the hydrological cycle. It is thus important to quantify changes in the Amazonian rainfall and clarify its mechanism. Previous studies indicate that the interannual variability of Amazonian precipitation could be largely attributed to variabilities in the South American monsoon system and the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation. However, the trend of the wet season tropical Amazonian precipitation during recent decades is not very well investigated. In this study, by combining both satellite and in situ observations, it is revealed that tropical Amazonian precipitation has significantly increased by ∼180 to 600 mm (in different datasets) in the wet season during the satellite era from 1979 to 2015. We then use a state-of-the-art atmospheric model to simulate the impact of the tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on the precipitation changes. Results show that the multidecadal warming of the tropical Atlantic has contributed more than half of this precipitation change over the past three decades, while the east Pacific cooling plays a secondary role. We finally combine the simulation results and the reanalysis data to investigate the mechanisms of this process, i.e. the SST variability dramatically increases the convergence of the moisture transport over the Amazon region. The precipitation changes over the Amazon region largely impact on the local hydrological cycle and the ecosystem, and have important impacts on the global climate system by mediating the teleconnection between the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. Our results show that the long-term change in the wet season Amazonian precipitation is important and deserves further investigation and discussion.},

abstract = {A portion of globally generated surface and groundwater resources evaporates from wetlands, waterbodies and irrigated areas. This secondary evaporation of blue water directly affects the remaining water resources available for ecosystems and human use. At the global scale, a lack of detailed water balance studies and direct observations limits our understanding of the magnitude and spatial and temporal distribution of secondary evaporation. Here, we propose a methodology to assimilate satellite-derived information into the landscape hydrological model W3 at an unprecedented 0.05°, or ca. 5 km resolution globally. The assimilated data are all derived from MODIS observations, including surface water extent, surface albedo, vegetation cover, leaf area index, canopy conductance and land surface temperature (LST). The information from these products is imparted on the model in a simple but efficient manner, through a combination of direct insertion of the surface water extent, an evaporation flux adjustment based on LST and parameter nudging for the other observations. The resulting water balance estimates were evaluated against river basin discharge records and the water balance of closed basins and demonstrably improved water balance estimates compared to ignoring secondary evaporation (e.g., bias improved from +38 to +2 mm yr-1). The evaporation estimates derived from assimilation were combined with global mapping of irrigation crops to derive a minimum estimate of irrigation water requirements (I0), representative of optimal irrigation efficiency. Our I0 estimates were lower than published country-level estimates of irrigation water use produced by alternative estimation methods, for reasons that are discussed. We estimate that 16 % of globally generated water resources evaporate before reaching the oceans, enhancing total terrestrial evaporation by 6.1×1012 m3 yr-1 or 8.8 %. Of this volume, 5 % is evaporated from irrigation areas, 58 % from terrestrial waterbodies and 37 % from other surfaces. Model-data assimilation at even higher spatial resolutions can achieve a further reduction in uncertainty but will require more accurate and detailed mapping of surface water dynamics and areas equipped for irrigation.},

abstract = {The precipitation variability over the eastern Amazon (EAM) and northeast Brazil (NEB) during the autumn rainy season (March to May) is diagnosed using raingauge-based weekly data from 1982 to 2001. Since precipitation in this region is remarkably modulated by the combined effects of the Pacific and Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies, two extreme and contrasting large-scale climatic scenarios are considered in this study. The unfavorable (UNFAV) scenario, defined by the simultaneous occurrences of the El Ni{\~{n}}o and northward SST gradient in the intertropical Atlantic and the favorable (FAV) scenario, by the simultaneous occurrence of the La Ni{\~{n}}a and southward SST gradient in the intertropical Atlantic. UNFAV (FAV) composites with unfiltered data show remarkable changes in both the Walker and the Hadley cells associated with the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) anomalously weakened (enhanced) thus with deficient (abundant) seasonal rainfall in most of the EAM/NEB. Precipitation variability is identified objectively through EOF analyses performed on the (30-70 day) intraseasonal and submonthly (≥21 day) filtered weekly precipitation anomalies for 18 autumn seasons (1983 to 2000). The principal components (PC) of the first mode of each analysis show strong oscillations. In particular, the oscillations of the PC series during UNFAV and FAV years reveal that events with anomalously deficient and abundant precipitation over the EAM/NEB occur alternately, even under extreme climatic conditions in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic. Composites based on events with anomalously increased precipitation (objectively selected from the PC series) on intraseasonal and submonthly scales are analyzed separately for the UNFAV and FAV years. These analyses show that for both scenarios the more important rainfall-producing atmospheric mechanism over the EAM/NEB on intraseasonal time scales consists of the establishment of deep convective bands trigged by South Atlantic Convergence Zone events or persistent frontal systems over northeast Brazil. Such a regional pattern is embedded in a large-scale dynamic environment related to the propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation over tropical South America. On the other hand, the main rainfall-producing atmospheric mechanism over the EAM/NEB on submonthly time scales is the Atlantic ITCZ during FAV years, whilst weakened Atlantic ITCZ activity may be forced by meridionally elongated mid-latitude wave trains in the upper troposphere during UNFAV years. {\textcopyright}Springer-Verlag/Wien 2005.},

This novel approach analyzes climate extreme events over the past four decades (1980–2016) using multiple gridded observation and reanalysis datasets. Furthermore, future changes in climate extremes are analyzed from 20 downscaled Earth System Models (ESMs) at high horizontal resolution (0.25° of latitude/longitude), under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Projected changes in the extreme indices are analyzed over mid-twenty-first century (2046–2065) and end-of-twenty-first century (2081–2100) relative to the reference period 1986–2005. Results show consistent warming patterns with increasing (decreasing) trends in warm (cold) extremes in the historical datasets. A similar but more intense warm pattern is projected in the mid and end of the twenty-first century. For precipitation indices, observations show an increase in consecutive dry days and a reduction of consecutive wet days over almost all Brazil. The frequency and intensity of extremely wet days over Brazil are expected to increase according to future scenarios. Designing effective adaptation and mitigation measures in response to changes in climate extremes events depends on this improved understanding of how conditions have and are likely to change in the future at regional scales.},

abstract = {This review surveys current and emerging drought monitoring approaches using satellite remote sensing observations from climatological and ecosystem perspectives. We argue that satellite observations not currently used for operational drought monitoring, such as near-surface air relative humidity data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder mission, provide opportunities to improve early drought warning. Current and future satellite missions offer opportunities to develop composite and multi-indicator drought models. While there are immense opportunities, there are major challenges including data continuity, unquantified uncertainty, sensor changes, and community acceptability. One of the major limitations of many of the currently available satellite observations is their short length of record. A number of relevant satellite missions and sensors (e.g., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) provide only a decade of data, which may not be sufficient to study droughts from a climate perspective. However, they still provide valuable information about relevant hydrologic and ecological processes linked to this natural hazard. Therefore, there is a need for models and algorithms that combine multiple data sets and/or assimilate satellite observations into model simulations to generate long-term climate data records. Finally, the study identifies a major gap in indicators for describing drought impacts on the carbon and nitrogen cycle, which are fundamental to assessing drought impacts on ecosystems.},

abstract = {With the aim of identifying the physical causes of variability of a given dynamical system, the geophysical community has made an extensive use of classical component extraction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or rotational techniques (RT). We introduce a recently developed algorithm based on information theory: independent component analysis (ICA). This new technique presents two major advantages over classical methods. First, it aims at extracting statistically independent components where classical techniques search for decorrelated components (i.e., a weaker constraint). Second, the linear hypothesis for the mixture of components is not required. In this paper, after having briefly summarized the essentials of classical techniques, we present the new method in the context of geophysical time series analysis. We then illustrate the ICA algorithm by applying it to the study of the variability of the tropical sea surface temperature (SST), with a particular emphasis on the analysis of the links between El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Atlantic SST variability. The new algorithm appears to be particularly efficient in describing the complexity of the phenomena and their various sources of variability in space and time.},

In this study, we show evidence of a fragile hydrological equilibrium in the western Amazon. While drainage systems located near the equator and the western Amazon do not show water deficit in years with average climate conditions, this equilibrium can be broken during drought events. More importantly, we show that this effect is persistent, taking years until the normal hydrological patterns are reestablished. We show clear links between persistent changes in forest canopy structure and changes in hydrological patterns, revealing physical evidence of hydrological mechanisms that may lead to permanent changes in parts of the Amazon ecosystem. If prospects of increasing drought frequency are confirmed, a change in the current hydroecological patterns in the western Amazon could take place in less than a decade.},

abstract = {<p>Recent advances in global flow routing schemes have shown the importance of using high-resolution topography for representing floodplain inundation dynamics more reliably. This study presents and evaluates the Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP), which is a global flow routing scheme specifically designed to bridge the gap between current state-of-the-art global flow routing schemes by combining their main features and introducing new features to better capture floodplain dynamics. The ultimate goals of HyMAP are to provide the scientific community with a novel scheme suited to the assimilation of satellite altimetry data for global water discharge forecasts and a model that can be potentially coupled with atmospheric models. In this first model evaluation, HyMAP is coupled with the Interactions between Soil–Biosphere–Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model in order to simulate the surface water dynamics in the Amazon basin. The model is evaluated over the 1986–2006 period against an unprecedented source of information, including in situ and satellite-based datasets of water discharge and level, flow velocity, and floodplain extent. Results show that the model can satisfactorily simulate the large-scale features of the water surface dynamics of the Amazon River basin. Among all stream gauges considered, 23% have Nash–Sutcliffe coefficients (NS) higher than 0.50 and 68% above zero. About 28% of the stations have volume errors lower than 15%. Simulated discharges at {\'{O}}bidos had NS = 0.89. Time series of simulated floodplains at the basin scale agrees well with satellite-based estimates, with a relative error of 7% and correlation of 0.89. These results indicate nonnegligible improvements in comparison to previous studies for the same region.</p>},

abstract = {Accurate and timely precipitation data are essential for monitoring and forecasting of floods and droughts. Yet, a fully global near-real-time (NRT) product that simultaneously provides good performance in convection- and snow-dominated regions as well as in densely gauged regions is still lacking. We developed a NRT variant of the recently released historic Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) dataset. MSWEP-NRT provides gap-free, fully global precipitation estimates with three-hourly temporal and 0.1° spatial resolution, by optimally merging gauge observations (GHCN-D and GSOD), satellite estimates (CMORPH, GSMaP, IMERG, and TMPA 3B42RT), and atmospheric model outputs (GDAS-Anl and JRA-55). To produce MSWEP-NRT, we first merge the satellite- and model-based data using weighted averaging, with weights based on the performance of the respective data sources at surrounding gauges. Next, the merged data are cumulative distribution function matched to the historic MSWEP dataset, resulting in a consistent precipitation record from 1979 until the near present. Finally, daily gauge corrections are applied, using a novel scheme that accounts for differences in the UTC boundary of the 24-hour accumulation period of gauge reports. To account for latency differences among the data sources and potential disruptions in data availability, MSWEP-NRT estimates less than seven days old are progressively upgraded to include any new data that have become available. The product has a latency of approximately four hours. An independent evaluation using NRT gauge observations demonstrates the efficacy of our merging approach.},

abstract = {Retrieving atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles from infrared satellite observations over continental surfaces is a complex problem because of the heterogeneity of land surfaces and the difficulty of modeling their interaction with the radiation. This results in the surface-sensitive observations from sounding instruments over land usually not being assimilated into numerical prediction systems at meteorological operational centers. Correct characterization of the interaction between the atmosphere and the surface would allow considering the information contained in those channels. This requires accurate estimates of the surface emissivities at the spectral resolution of recent instruments such as Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) or Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). An emissivity interpolator is developed in this study to estimate the land surface emissivities at a high spectral resolution compatible with IASI or AIRS instrument channels. It is based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrieved emissivities. This surface emissivity is used as a first guess in an innovative surface parameter inversion scheme that simultaneously retrieves the surface emissivity and temperature. Radiative transfer calculations with the resulting surface information show a significantly better agreement with the observations (root mean square error of 1.7K on average over bands 1 and 2 of the IASI spectrum), as compared to calculations using the first guess information (root mean square error of 3.5K). The retrieved surface skin temperatures are compared to the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (LSA SAF) estimates derived from Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) measurements, and the root mean square difference is below 2K.

abstract = {The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program maintains a suite of instruments in various locations to provide continuous monitoring of atmospheric parameters. Temperature and humidity retrievals are two of the key parameters used by the climate-modeling community. Accuracy in the spectroscopy adopted by the various radiative transfer models is crucial for obtaining accurate retrievals. While the accuracy of the spectroscopic parameters used for water-vapor retrievals is satisfactory, temperature retrievals continue to be affected by uncertainties in oxygen line parameters leading to discrepancies between the modeled and observed brightness temperatures. In this paper, we compare the model calculations in the oxygen-band channels with the measurements collected by the ARM-operated 12-channel Microwave Radiometer Profiler (MWRP). The dataset used spans a wide range of atmospheric temperature conditions, with ground temperatures varying between -40degC and +20degC. Model calculations are performed by using line parameters from the high-resolution transmission molecular-absorption (HITRAN) database and from a set of newly published parameters. Our comparison shows that the newly published parameters agree more closely with the MWRP measurements and confirms the need to update the HITRAN database for the oxygen lines. We show the effect of line parameters on the retrievals of temperature, water vapor, and liquid water, and show that improved oxygen absorption is essential to reduce the clear-sky bias in the liquid-water path retrievals},

abstract = {Mesoscale to synoptic-scale squall lines that form along the northeastern coast of South America as sea-breeze-induced instability lines and propagate through the Amazon Basin are investigated using data collected during the April–May 1987 Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE 2B).These systems, termed “Amazon coastal squall lines” (ACSL), have been noted by others, but details of the structure and evolution of the ACSL are limited. The present paper uses Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, radar, upper-air rawinsonde, and surface Portable Automated Mesonet data to describe the structure, dynamics, and life cycle of the ACSL. Twelve ACSL were sampled during ABLE 2B, and three cases are discussed in detail.The ACSL are discontinuous lines of organized mesoscale cloud clusters that propagate across the central Amazon Basin at speeds of 50–60 km h−1. The ACSL undergo six possible life cycle stages: coastal genesis, intensification, maturity, weakening, reintensification, and dissipation. Analysis also indicates that mesoscale clusters within the ACSL are composed of three distinct cloud components: a prestorm region that often contains towering cumulus, leading edge convection (LEC), and multiple, precipitating cloud layers in the trailing stratiform region (TSR).Divergence and vertical velocity calculations indicate deep vertical ascent in the LEC and a region of midlevel convergence (≈500 mb) in the TSR. The latter midlevel convergence is associated with a weak updraft above 500 mb and an unsaturated downdraft below. Vertical motions in the TSR are an order of magnitude smaller than in the LEC.Substantial shear in the low-level inflow occurs in all three case studies and, as suggested by model simulations, may play an important role in the longevity (24–48 h) of the ACSL. Profiles of equivalent potential temperature $\theta$e, taken from the prestorm, leading edge convection and trailing stratiform regions demonstrate that the ACSL stabilize the troposphere in their wake and remove a tropospheric minimum of $\theta$e. It is hypothesized that the removal of this minimum is accomplished both by direct mixing via vertical motions in the LEC ("hot towers") and also through detrainment in the multiple-layered TSR. Part I describes the structure and kinematics of the ACSL, while Part II deals with the heat and moisture transports of these systems.},

abstract = {Water resource management has faced challenges in recent decades due to limited in situ observations and the limitations of hydrodynamic modeling. Data assimilation techniques have been proposed to improve hydrodynamic model outputs of local rivers (river length ≤ 1500 km) using synthetic observations of the future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission to overcome limited in situ observations and the limitations of hydrodynamic modeling. However, large-scale data assimilation schemes require computationally efficient filtering techniques, such as the Local Ensemble Transformation Kalman Filter (LETKF). Expansion of the assimilation domain to maximize observations is limited by error covariance caused by limited ensemble size in complex river networks, such as the Congo River. Therefore, we tested the LETKF algorithm in a continental-scale river (river length > 1500 km) using a physically based empirical localization method to maximize the observations available while filtering error covariance areas. Physically based empirical local patches were derived separately for each river pixel, considering spatial auto-correlations. An observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) was performed using empirical localization parameters to evaluate the potential of our method for estimating discharge. We found our method could improve discharge estimates considerably without affected from error covariance while fully using the available observations. We compared this experiment using empirical localization parameters with conventional fixed-shape local patches of different sizes. The empirical local patch OSSE showed the lowest normalized root mean square error of discharge for the entire Congo basin. Extending the conventional local patch without considering spatial auto-correlation results in very large errors in LETKF assimilation due to error covariance between small tributaries. The empirical local patch method has the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional local patches for continental-scale rivers using SWOT observations.},

Simultaneous atmospheric soundings at forest and pasture sites during the Rondonian Boundary Layer Experiment (RBLE-3) elucidate the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed correlation between clouds and land cover. We demonstrate that the atmospheric boundary layer over the forested areas is more unstable and characterized by larger values of the corrective available potential energy (CAPE) due to greater humidity than that which is found over the deforested area. The shallow convection over the deforested areas is relatively more active than the deep convection over the forested areas. This greater activity results from a stronger lifting mechanism caused by mesoscale circulations driven by deforestation-induced heterogeneities in land cover.},

abstract = {Human water use, climate change and land conversion have created a water crisis for billions of individuals and many ecosystems worldwide. Global water stocks and fluxes are estimated empirically and with computer models, but this information is conveyed to policymakers and researchers through water cycle diagrams. Here we compiled a synthesis of the global water cycle, which we compared with 464 water cycle diagrams from around the world. Although human freshwater appropriation now equals half of global river discharge, only 15% of the water cycle diagrams depicted human interaction with water. Only 2% of the diagrams showed climate change or water pollution—two of the central causes of the global water crisis—which effectively conveys a false sense of water security. A single catchment was depicted in 95% of the diagrams, which precludes the representation of teleconnections such as ocean–land interactions and continental moisture recycling. These inaccuracies correspond with specific dimensions of water mismanagement, which suggest that flaws in water diagrams reflect and reinforce the misunderstanding of global hydrology by policymakers, researchers and the public. Correct depictions of the water cycle will not solve the global water crisis, but reconceiving this symbol is an important step towards equitable water governance, sustainable development and planetary thinking in the Anthropocene. Only about 15% of water cycle diagrams include human interaction with water, although human freshwater appropriation amounts to about half of global river discharge, according to an analysis of 464 water cycle diagrams and a synthesis of the global water cycle.},

abstract = {[1] A common practice in sea level research is to analyze separately the variability of the steric and mass components of sea level. However, there are conceptual and practical issues that have sometimes been misinterpreted, leading to erroneous and contradictory conclusions on regional sea level variability. The crucial point to be noted is that the steric component does not account for volume changes but does for volume changes per mass unit (i.e., density changes). This indicates that the steric component only represents actual volume changes when the mass of the considered water body remains constant. This is for instance the case of thermal expansions/contractions due to surface heat fluxes. Conversely, salinity changes are often linked to net mass changes and therefore not only affect the steric component but also imply a change in the mass component that must be considered when quantifying the overall sea level budget. In this paper, we clarify the interpretation of the steric and mass components by identifying the main physical processes contributing to each of them, with particular emphasis on the role of salinity. The case of the Mediterranean Sea is examined as a paradigmatic example of a semienclosed basin where sea level components must be carefully interpreted. Because of the significant salinity changes shown by most projections of the Mediterranean climate, a misinterpretation of the steric and mass components can lead to underestimations of $\sim$40 cm in the sea level of the Mediterranean Sea projected for the end of the 21st century.

abstract = {With a growing number of available datasets especially from satellite remote sensing, there is a great opportunity to improve our knowledge of the state of the hydrological processes via data assimilation. Observations can be assimilated into numerical models using dynamics and data-driven approaches. The present study aims to assess these assimilation frameworks for integrating different sets of satellite measurements in a hydrological context. To this end, we implement a traditional data assimilation system based on the Square Root Analysis (SQRA) filtering scheme and the newly developed data-driven Kalman-Takens technique to update the water components of a hydrological model with the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage (TWS), and soil moisture products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) in a 5-day temporal scale. While SQRA relies on a physical model for forecasting, the Kalman-Takens only requires a trajectory of the system based on past data. We are particularly interested in testing both methods for assimilating different combination of the satellite data. In most of the cases, simultaneous assimilation of the satellite data by either standard SQRA or Kalman-Takens achieves the largest improvements in the hydrological state, in terms of the agreement with independent in-situ measurements. Furthermore, the Kalman-Takens approach performs comparably well to dynamical method at a fraction of the computational cost.},

abstract = {Recently developed methodologies such as climate reanalysis make it possible to create a historical record of climate systems. This paper proposes a methodology called Hydrological Retrospective (HR), which essentially simulates large rainfall datasets, using this as input into hydrological models to develop a record of past hydrology, making it possible to analyze past floods and droughts. We developed a methodology for the Amazon basin, where studies have shown an increase in the intensity and frequency of hydrological extreme events in recent decades. We used eight large precipitation datasets (more than 30 years) as input for a large scale hydrological and hydrodynamic model (MGB-IPH). HR products were then validated against several in situ discharge gauges controlling the main Amazon sub-basins, focusing on maximum and minimum events. For the most accurate HR, based on performance metrics, we performed a forecast skill of HR to detect floods and droughts, comparing the results with in-situ observations. A statistical temporal series trend was performed for intensity of seasonal floods and droughts in the entire Amazon basin. Results indicate that HR could represent most past extreme events well, compared with in-situ observed data, and was consistent with many events reported in literature. Because of their flow duration, some minor regional events were not reported in literature but were captured by HR. To represent past regional hydrology and seasonal hydrological extreme events, we believe it is feasible to use some large precipitation datasets such as i) climate reanalysis, which is mainly based on a land surface component, and ii) datasets based on merged products. A significant upward trend in intensity was seen in maximum annual discharge (related to floods) in western and northwestern regions and for minimum annual discharge (related to droughts) in south and central-south regions of the Amazon basin. Because of the global coverage of rainfall datasets, this methodology can be transferred to other regions for better estimation of future hydrological behavior and its impact on society.},

abstract = {Patterns of surface sediment concentration distribution in rivers are significant for understanding fluvial morphodynamics and environmental characteristics of the rivers and their floodplains. In the case of the Amazon Basin, complexity in sediment pattern distribution is affected by the anabranching channel pattern of the Amazon River, inputs from tributaries (some of which are among the largest rivers on Earth) and the existence of huge and complex floodplains. In this paper, patterns of surface sediment distribution are modeled based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over the Amazon River by estimating surface sediment concentrations. Specifically, we aim to 1) detect the regional and seasonal variability of surface sediment in the main channel, 2) observe the influence of tributaries into the main system, 3) identify channel-floodplain interactions, and 4) investigate the internal variability of surface sediment along the main channel system. Field surface sediment concentration data from three gauging stations representing the upstream, midstream, and downstream sections of the Amazon River between 2000 and 2010 were used to calibrate 1328 MODIS daily surface reflectance images. Robust empirical models were derived between field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data from each station (0.79<R2<0.92, slopes significant at 99% confidence level) from 752 selected data after quality control. We applied empirical models to 2112 8-day composite surface reflectance images to generate surface sediment distribution maps since 2000. Overall, this study successfully demonstrated the capability of our MODIS-based model to capture the spatial and temporal variability of surface sediments in the Amazon River Basin, the largest river system on Earth. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The initial satellite precipitation data comparisons show that the reanalyzed 3B42V6, with a bias of -4.54%, matched best with the rain gauge observations, while the two near real-time satellite datasets (3B42RT and CMORPH) largely underestimated precipitation by 42.72% and 40.81% respectively. With the model parameters first benchmarked by the rain gauge data, the behavior of the streamflow simulation from the 3B42V6 was also the most optimal amongst the three products, while the two near real-time satellite datasets produced deteriorated biases and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSCEs). Still, when the model parameters were recalibrated by each individual satellite data, the performance of the streamflow simulations from the two near real-time satellite products were significantly improved, thus demonstrating the need for specific calibrations of the hydrological models for the near real-time satellite inputs. Moreover, when optimally merged with respect to the streamflows forced by the two near real-time satellite precipitation products and all the three satellite precipitation products using the Bayesian model averaging method, the resulted streamflow series further improved and became more robust. In summary, the three current state-of-the-art satellite precipitation products have demonstrated potential in hydrological research and applications. The benchmarking, recalibration, and optimal merging schemes for streamflow simulation at a basin scale described in the present work will hopefully be a reference for future utilizations of satellite precipitation products in global and regional hydrological applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Changes in terrestrial water storage as observed by the satellite gravity mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) represent a new and completely independent way to constrain the net flux imbalance in atmospheric reanalyses. In this study daily GRACE gravity field changes are used for the first time to investigate high-frequency hydro-meteorological fluxes over the continents. Band-pass filtered water fluxes are derived from GRACE water storage time series by first applying a numerical differentiation filter and subsequent high-pass filtering to isolate fluxes at periods between 5 and 30 days corresponding to typical time-scales of weather system persistence at moderate latitudes. By comparison with the latest atmospheric reanalysis ERA5 of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF) we show that daily GRACE gravity field models contain realistic high-frequency water flux information. Furthermore, GRACE-derived water fluxes can clearly identify improvements realized within ERA5 over its direct predecessor ERA-Interim particularly in equatorial and temperate climate zones. The documented improvements are in good agreement with rain gauge validation, but GRACE also identifies three distinct regions (Sahel Zone, Okavango Catchment, Kimberley Plateau) with a slight degradation of net-fluxes in ERA5 with respect to ERA-Interim, thereby highlighting the potentially added value of non-standard daily GRACE gravity series for hydro-meteorological monitoring purposes.},

abstract = {Throughout the world there are many stressed aquifers used to support irrigated agriculture. The Condamine River catchment (southern Queensland, Australia) is one example of a globally significant agricultural region where groundwater use has exceeded recharge over the last 50years. There is a high dependence on groundwater in this catchment, because yearly rainfall is highly variable, and actual evapotranspiration often exceeds rainfall. To better manage the aquifer there is a need to correctly conceptualise the primary inputs and outputs of the system, and characterise the lags in system response to all forcings. In catchment models it is particularly important to correctly proportion diffuse (areal) rainfall recharge and to account for the lag between rainfall and recharge at the water table. Throughout large portions of the Condamine Catchment, groundwater levels are now 20 or more metres below the ground surface. This study aimed to better quantify the lag between rainfall and recharge at the water table using the predefined impulse response function in continuous time method (PIRFICT; von Asmuth et al., 2002; von Asmuth, 2012). The PIRFICT method was applied to 255 multi-decadal groundwater level data sets throughout the catchment. Inputs into the modelling include rainfall, irrigation deep drainage, stream water level, evapotranspiration, and groundwater extractions. As an independent check the PIRFICT model derived diffuse recharge estimates are compared to point lysimeter and geochemical recharge estimates in the Vertosol soils within this catchment. It is estimated using the PIRFICT method that in the Condamine Catchment between 1990 and 2012, the mean rain-derived groundwater recharge is 4.4mm/year. Mean groundwater response from rainfall was determined to be 5.3years: range 188days to 48years. The recharge estimates are consistent with both geochemical and lysimeter point measurements of recharge. It is concluded that where extensive groundwater level and climatic data sets are available the PIRFICT method provides an independent assessment of recharge. Importantly, the PIRFICT method highlights the need to consider the lag between rainfall and recharge at the water table. This lag is often overlooked when calibrating spatial distributed water balance models used to guide groundwater allocations.},

abstract = {Given their strong interaction with both climate and the carbon cycle, wetlands and surface waters need to be parameterized in global general circulation models. For this purpose, a new simple flooding river scheme is proposed and evaluated over South America. The flood dynamics is described through the coupling between the ISBA land surface model and the TRIP river routing model including a prognostic flood reservoir. This reservoir fills when the river height exceeds a critical value and vice versa. The reservoir interacts with the soil hydrology through infiltration and with the overlying atmosphere through precipitation interception and free water surface evaporation. The model is tested in off-line mode using the 10-year ISLSCP-2 atmospheric forcing. The evaluation is made against satellite-derived inundation estimates as well as in situ river discharge observations. Besides a basin-scale increase in annual surface evaporation, the results show improved monthly discharges over the Amazon and Parana rivers, as well as a reasonable agreement between the simulated flooded areas and satellite-derived inundation estimates.

abstract = {Although previous studies have considered the long-term variability of precipitation and river discharge in the Amazon basin, other components of the hydrologic cycle, such as evapotranspiration and the transport of water vapor, have not received the same attention. This study examines the 20-year variability of the full hydrologic budget of the Amazon basin, using a 1976-1996 time series from the National Centers for Environmental Protection/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalyzed meteorological data set. Within this 20-year record, there is a statistically significant decreasing trend in the atmospheric transport of water vapor both into and out of the Amazon basin. This trend is associated with a general relaxation of the southeasterly trade winds, a weakening of the east-to-west pressure gradient, and a warming of the sea surface temperatures in the equatorial South Atlantic region. While the atmospheric transport of water vapor through the Amazon basin has decreased, the internal recycling of precipitation within the basin increased and basin-wide precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff have remained nearly constant. Even though basin-average precipitation and runoff have remained fairly stable, other components of the Amazon basin's hydrologic cycle have been altered significantly by large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation.

abstract = {The meteorological observations from satellites in the microwave domain are currently limited to below 190 GHz. The next generation of European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Polar System-Second Generation will carry an instrument, the ice cloud imager (ICI), with frequencies up to 664 GHz, to improve the characterization of the cloud frozen phase. In this paper, a statistical retrieval of cloud parameters for ICI is developed, trained on a synthetic database derived from the coupling of a mesoscale cloud model and radiative transfer calculations. The hydrometeor profiles simulated with the weather research and forecasting model (WRF) for 12 diverse European mid-latitude situations are used to simulate the brightness temperatures with the atmospheric radiative transfer simulator (ARTS) to prepare the retrieval database. The WRF+ARTS simulations have been compared with the special sensor microwave imager/sounder observations up to 190 GHz: this successful evaluation gives us confidence in the simulations at the ICI channels from 183 to 664 GHz. Statistical analyses have been performed on this simulated retrieval database, showing that it is not only physically realistic but also statistically satisfactory for retrieval purposes. A first neural network (NN) classifier is used to detect the cloud presence. A second NN is developed to retrieve the liquid and ice-integrated cloud quantities over sea and land separately. The detection and retrieval of the hydrometeor quantities (i.e., ice, snow, graupel, rain, and liquid cloud) are performed with ICI-only, and with ICI combined with observations from the microwave imager (MWI, also on board MetOp-SG). The ICI channels have been optimized for the detection and quantification of the cloud frozen phase. Adding the MWI channels improves the performances of the vertically integrated content mostly for the cloud liquid phase. The relative error for the retrieved integrated frozen water content (FWP, i.e., ice+snow+graupel) is below 40% for 0.1 kg/m2< FWP < 0.5 kg/m2 and below 20% for FWP > 0.5 kg/m2.},

Two daily gravity field solutions based on observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission are evaluated against daily river runoff data for major flood events in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD) in 2004 and 2007. The trends over periods of a few days of the daily GRACE data reflect temporal variations in daily river runoff during major flood events. This is especially true for the larger flood in 2007, which featured two distinct periods of critical flood level exceedance in the Brahmaputra River. This first hydrological evaluation of daily GRACE gravity field solutions based on a Kalman filter approach confirms their potential for gravity-based large-scale flood monitoring. This particularly applies to short-lived, high-volume floods, as they occur in the GBD with a 4-5-year return period. The release of daily GRACE gravity field solutions in near-real time may enable flood monitoring for large events.},

abstract = {High spatiotemporal resolution of terrestrial total water storage plays a key role in assessing trends and availability of water resources. This study presents a two-step method for downscaling GRACE-derived total water storage anomaly (GRACE TWSA) from its original coarse spatiotemporal resolution (monthly, 3-degree spherical cap/$\sim$300 km) to a high resolution (daily, 5 km) through combining land surface model (LSM) simulated high spatiotemporal resolution terrestrial water storage anomaly (LSM TWSA). In the first step, an iterative adjustment method based on the self-calibration variance-component model (SCVCM) is used to spatially downscale the monthly GRACE TWSA to the high spatial resolution of the LSM TWSA. In the second step, the spatially downscaled monthly GRACE TWSA is further downscaled to the daily temporal resolution. By applying the method to downscale the coarse resolution GRACE TWSA from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) mascon solution with the daily high spatial resolution (5 km) LSM TWSA from the Ecological Assimilation of Land and Climate Observations (EALCO) model, we evaluated the benefit and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is capable to downscale GRACE TWSA spatiotemporally with reduced uncertainty. The downscaled GRACE TWSA are also evaluated through in-situ groundwater monitoring well observations and the results show a certain level agreement between the estimated and observed trends.},

Several interpolation procedures are tested to transform point to areal measurements, including the maximum entropy estimation method.

The Mann-Kendall test and a regression analysis were used to assess the direction and rate of change to both indices. Over the period of 1976-2000, East Asia, Central America, and Brazil exhibited a decrease in the number of both wet and light precipitation days, and eastern Europe exhibited a decrease in the number of both wet and moderate precipitation days. In contrast, the U.S., southern South America, western Europe, and Australia exhibited an increase in the number of both wet and light precipitation days.

Pondering problems related to changes in land use, new issues are emerging, such as, climate change and its negative effects on the regional hydrological cycle. The higher frequency of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a seems to have strong influence on rainfall in Amazonia. They are becoming more lasting and intense in the course of the last 20 to 30 years compared to the past 100 years. This paper may confront the scientific knowledge of the relations of climate and water resources in Amazon with the points of vulnerability that anthropic societies present in the region. The impact of climate change is not uniformly borne by different regions and populations. Actually, individuals, sectors and systems are affected to varying degrees and, besides, they may be prejudiced to a greater or lesser extent. These impacts vary in magnitude and intensity in accordance with certain aspects, for instance, geographical location, time, the prevalent social, economic and environmental conditions and the infra-structure of a given location. A comprehensive description of these extreme climate events is one of the first steps to a regional vulnerability approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Triple collocation (TC) is routinely used to resolve approximated linear relationships between different measurements (or representations) of a geophysical variable that are subject to errors. It has been utilized in the context of calibration, validation, bias correction, and error characterization to allow comparisons of diverse data records from various direct and indirect measurement techniques including in situ remote sensing and model-based approaches. However, successful applications of TC require sufficiently large numbers of coincident data points from three independent time series and, within the analysis period, homogeneity of their linear relationships and error structures. These conditions are difficult to realize in practice due to infrequent spatiotemporal sampling of satellite and ground-based sensors. TC can, however, be generalized within the framework of instrumental variable (IV) regression theory to address some of the conceptual constraints of TC. We review the theoretics of IV and consider one possible strategy to circumvent the three-data constraint by use of lagged variables (LV) as instruments. This particular implementation of IV is suitable for circumstances where multiple data records are limited and the geophysical variable of interest is sampled at time intervals shorter than its temporal correlation length. As a demonstration of utility, the LV method is applied to microwave satellite soil moisture data sets to recover their errors over Australia and to estimate temporal properties of their relationships with in situ and model data. These results are compared against standard two-data linear estimators and the TC estimator as benchmark.},

abstract = {Assessing the risk of a historical-level flood is essential for regional flood protection and resilience establishment. However, due to the limited spatiotemporal coverage of observations, the impact assessment relies on model simulations and is thus subject to uncertainties from cascade physical processes. This study assesses the flood hazard map with uncertainties subject to different combinations of runoff inputs, variables for flood frequency analysis and fitting distributions based on estimations by the CaMa-Flood global hydrodynamic model. Our results show that deviation in the runoff inputs is the most influential source of uncertainties in the estimated flooded water depth and inundation area, contributing more than 80 % of the total uncertainties investigated in this study. Global and regional inundation maps for floods with 1-in-100 year return periods show large uncertainty values but small uncertainty ratios for river channels and lakes, while the opposite results are found for dry zones and mountainous regions. This uncertainty is a result of increasing variation at tails among various fitting distributions. In addition, the uncertainty between selected variables is limited but increases from the regular period to the rarer floods, both for the water depth at points and for inundation area over regions. The uncertainties in inundation area also lead to uncertainties in estimating the population and economy exposure to the floods. In total, inundation accounts for 9.1 % [8.1 %-10.3 %] of the land area for a 1-in-100 year flood, leading to 13.4 % [12.1 %-15 %] of population exposure and 13.1 % [11.8 %-14.7 %] of economic exposure for the globe. The flood exposure and uncertainties vary by continent and the results in Africa have the largest uncertainty, probably due to the limited observations to constrain runoff simulations, indicating a necessity to improve the performance of different hydrological models especially for data-limited regions.},

abstract = {The location of eight rainfall stations in the Zongo valley (Eastern Cordillera-Bolivia) between 1195 and 4750 meters above sea level (masl) gives a unique opportunity to study the time-space rainfall variability between two regions, i.e. the Altiplano and the Amazonian lowlands of Bolivia, that are differently related to El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the Pacific. In the central part of the lowlands, a La Ni{\~{n}}a/dry signal is observed during the peak of the rainy season (February) and around wintertime (May and September). Going toward the Andes and on the foothills up to 1500 masl, no ENSO signal has been found. On the median slopes of the Zongo valley, between 1800 and 3500 m, a strong Ni{\~{n}}o/dry signal is depicted on an annual timescale and during summer. In February, a Ni{\~{n}}a/wet signal is also significant. Going westward through the high Andes and the eastern Altiplano, this signal weakens. On the western edge of the Altiplano, an El Ni{\~{n}}o/dry and La Ni{\~{n}}a/wet signals are clearly identified. In the central lowlands and on the western Altiplano, ENSO indexes account for nearly 25% of rainfall variability, and for as much as 50% along the median slopes of the eastern Cordillera, in the Zongo valley. This finding deserves further study as previous researches have shown that in the Andes the best relationship between rainfall and equatorial Pacific sea-surface temperature (SST) is in the westem Altiplano, far from the Amazonian source of moisture.

abstract = {The measurement of global precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, is critical to a wide range of users and applications. Rain gauges are indispensable in the measurement of precipitation, remaining the de facto standard for precipitation information across Earth's surface for hydrometeorological purposes. However, their distribution across the globe is limited: over land their distribution and density is variable, while over oceans very few gauges exist and where measurements are made, they may not adequately reflect the rainfall amounts of the broader area. Critically, the number of gauges available, or appropriate for a particular study, varies greatly across the Earth owing to temporal sampling resolutions, periods of operation, data latency, and data access. Numbers of gauges range from a few thousand available in near–real time to about 100,000 for all “official” gauges, and to possibly hundreds of thousands if all possible gauges are included. Gauges routinely used in the generation of global precipitation products cover an equivalent area of between about 250 and 3,000 m2. For comparison, the center circle of a soccer pitch or tennis court is about 260 m2. Although each gauge should represent more than just the gauge orifice, autocorrelation distances of precipitation vary greatly with regime and the integration period. Assuming each Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC)–available gauge is independent and represents a surrounding area of 5-km radius, this represents only about 1% of Earth's surface. The situation is further confounded for snowfall, which has a greater measurement uncertainty.},

abstract = {Proliferation of evapotranspiration (ET) products warrants comparison of these products. The study objective was to assess uncertainty in ET output from four land surface models (LSMs), Noah, Mosaic, VIC, and SAC in NLDAS-2, two remote sensing-based products, MODIS and AVHRR, and GRACE-inferred ET from a water budget with precipitation from PRISM, monitored runoff, and total water storage change (TWSC) from GRACE satellites. The three cornered hat method, which does not require a priori knowledge of the true ET value, was used to estimate ET uncertainties. In addition, TWSC or total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE was compared with water budget estimates of TWSC from a flux-based approach or TWSA from a storage-based approach. The analyses were conducted using data from three regions (humid-arid) in the South Central United States as case studies. Uncertainties in ET are lowest in LSM ET (∼5 mm/mo), moderate in MODIS or AVHRR-based ET (10-15 mm/mo), and highest in GRACE-inferred ET (20-30 mm/month). There is a trade-off between spatial resolution and uncertainty, with lower uncertainty in the coarser-resolution LSM ET (∼14 km) relative to higher uncertainty in the finer-resolution (∼1-8 km) RS ET. Root-mean-square (RMS) of uncertainties in water budget estimates of TWSC is about half of RMS of uncertainties in GRACE-derived TWSC for each of the regions. Future ET estimation should consider a hybrid approach that integrates strengths of LSMs and satellite-based products to constrain uncertainties.

In this study we review existing implementations of soil moisture TC analysis as well as investigations of the assumptions underlying the method. Different notations that are used to formulate the TC problem are shown to be mathematically identical. While many studies have investigated issues related to possible violations of the underlying assumptions, only few TC modifications have been proposed to mitigate the impact of these violations. Moreover, assump-tions, which are often understood as a limitation that is unique to TC analysis are shown to be common also to other conventional performance metrics. Noteworthy advances in TC analysis have been made in the way error estimates are being presented by moving from the investigation of absolute error vari-ance estimates to the investigation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metrics. Here we review existing error presentations and propose the combined investigation of the SNR (expressed in logarithmic units), the unscaled error variances, and the soil moisture sensitivities of the data sets as an optimal strategy for the evaluation of remotely-sensed soil moisture data sets.},

abstract = {This paper describes the impacts of new river geomorphic and flow parameterizations on the simulated surface waters dynamics of the Amazon River basin. Three major improvements to a hydrologic model are presented: (1) the river flow velocity equation is expanded to be dependent on river sinuosity and friction in addition to gradient forces; (2) equations defining the morphological characteristics of the river, such as river height, width and bankfull volume, are derived from 31 622 measurements of river morphology and applied within the model; (3) 1 km resolution topographic data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) are used to provide physically based fractional flooding of grid cells from a statistical representation of sub-grid-scale floodplain morphology. The discharge and floodplain inundation of the Amazon River is simulated for the period 1968-1998, validated against observations, and compared with results from a previous version of the model. These modifications result in considerable improvement in the simulations of the hydrological features of the Amazon River system. The major impact is that the average wet-season flooded area on the Amazon mainstem for the period 1983-1988 is now within 5% of satellite-derived estimates of flooded area, whereas the previous model overestimates the flooded area by about 80%. The improvements are a consequence of the new empirical river geomorphologic functions and the SRTM topography. The new formulation of the flow velocity equation results in increased river velocity on the mainstem and major tributaries and a better correlation between the mean monthly simulated and observed discharge.

abstract = {Influences of climatic change and anthropogenic activities on the terrestrial water storage (TWS) change are significant in the mid- and high-latitude areas. Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission has provided quantitative measurements of TWS changes with unprecedented accuracy at global, regional and basin scales. In this study, the noise level of various GRACE-derived TWS anomalies (TWSA) data were evaluated by using a generalized three-cornered hat (GTCH) method. A time-dependent weights approach was adopted to obtain a combined TWSA series over the Songhua River Basin (SRB) from 2003 to 2013. Monthly TWSA data during the past decades (1982–2002) were reconstructed by using an artificial neural network (ANN) approach with the good performance evaluated by the correlation coefficient of 0.89 and the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency of 0.79 over the study region. In-situ groundwater level measurements were used for validation of the groundwater storage (GWS) changes (estimated by using GRACE-derived TWS changes in association with the other simulated components of water storage changes from land surface models (LSMs)). The primary driving factors of spatiotemporal variations of GWS, as well as their inter-/intra-annually varying characteristics, were explored. The present study revealed that the variations of GWS featured a “downward fluctuations” (1982–1994), “stable upward” (1998–2008) and “decreasing dramatically” (2009–2013) period, respectively, over the SRB. In general, GWS had varied in a steady decline trend at a decreasing rate of 1.04 ± 0.59 mm year −1 from 1982 to 1994.

The trends over periods of a few days of the daily GRACE data reflect temporal variations in daily river runoff during major flood events. This is especially true for the larger flood in 2007, which featured two distinct periods of critical flood level exceedance in the Brahmaputra River. This first hydrological evaluation of daily GRACE gravity field solutions based on a Kalman filter approach confirms their potential for gravity-based large-scale flood monitoring. This particularly applies to short-lived, high-volume floods, as they occur in the GBD with a 4-5-year return period. The release of daily GRACE gravity field solutions in near-real time may enable flood monitoring for large events.},

abstract = {Concerted political attention has focused on reducing deforestation, and this remains the cornerstone of most biodiversity conservation strategies. However, maintaining forest cover may not reduce anthropogenic forest disturbances, which are rarely considered in conservation programmes. These disturbances occur both within forests, including selective logging and wildfires, and at the landscape level, through edge, area and isolation effects. Until now, the combined effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the conservation value of remnant primary forests has remained unknown, making it impossible to assess the relative importance of forest disturbance and forest loss. Here we address these knowledge gaps using a large data set of plants, birds and dung beetles (1,538, 460 and 156 species, respectively) sampled in 36 catchments in the Brazilian state of Par{\'{a}}. Catchments retaining more than 69-80% forest cover lost more conservation value from disturbance than from forest loss. For example, a 20% loss of primary forest, the maximum level of deforestation allowed on Amazonian properties under Brazil's Forest Code, resulted in a 39-54% loss of conservation value: 96-171% more than expected without considering disturbance effects. We extrapolated the disturbance-mediated loss of conservation value throughout Par{\'{a}}, which covers 25% of the Brazilian Amazon. Although disturbed forests retained considerable conservation value compared with deforested areas, the toll of disturbance outside Par{\'{a}}'s strictly protected areas is equivalent to the loss of 92,000-139,000 km2 of primary forest. Even this lowest estimate is greater than the area deforested across the entire Brazilian Amazon between 2006 and 2015 (ref. 10). Species distribution models showed that both landscape and within-forest disturbances contributed to biodiversity loss, with the greatest negative effects on species of high conservation and functional value. These results demonstrate an urgent need for policy interventions that go beyond the maintenance of forest cover to safeguard the hyper-diversity of tropical forest ecosystems.},

In particular, two sampling algorithms are examined: the traditional uniform sampling that lists all possible situations and the clustering sampling (K-means) that respects the natural variability probability distribution functions. In order to assess the quality of both sampling methods, the extracted databases are used to extract first guesses for satellite remote sensing schemes. They are also employed as training databases for the calibration of statistical retrieval algorithms. The analysis of these sampling algorithms is illustrated by constructing both a first guess (FG) extraction and a retrieval databases of temperature and water vapor profiles over sea for the Atmospheric Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) instrument. The advantages and problems of each sampling approach are thoroughly examined and sensitivity studies are conducted to analyze the impact on the FG extraction and retrieval of various algorithmic parameters such as the distance being used, the size of the databases, or the instrumental noise sensitivity. The K-means clustering algorithm, not yet used for this kind of problems, is very efficient compared to the more traditional uniform sampling approach. It is also shown that it is important to have quasi-automatic and flexible tools that can be used to generate problem-specific databases.},

abstract = {We present an operational two-source (soil + vegetation) model for evaluating the surface energy balance given measurements of the rate of change in radio-metric surface temperature (T(RAD)) during the morning hours. This model consists of a two-source surface component describing the relation between T(RAD) and sensible heat flux, coupled with a time-integrated component connecting surface heating with planetary boundary layer development. By typing together the time-dependent behavior of surface temperature and the temperature in the boundary layer with the flux of sensible heat from the surface to the atmosphere, the need for ancillary measurements of near-surface air temperature is eliminated. This is a significant benefit when T(BAD) is acquired remotely. Air temperature can be strongly coupled to local biophysical surface conditions and, if the surface air and brightness temperature measurements used by a model are not collocated, energy flux estimates can be significantly corrupted. Furthermore, because this model uses only temporal changes in radiometric temperatures rather than absolute temperatures, time-independent biases in T(RAD) resulting from effects or other sources, do not affect the estimated fluxes; only time-varying component of corrections need be computed. The algorithm also decomposes the surface radiometric temperature into its soil and vegetation contributions, thus the angular dependence of T(RAD) can be predicted from an observation of T(RAD) at a single view angle. This capability is critical to an accurate interpretation of off-nadir measurements from polar orbiting and geosynchronous satellites, the performance of this model has been evaluated in comparison with data collected during two large-scale field experiments: the first International Satellite LAnd Surface Climatology Project field experiment, conducted in and around the Konza Prairie in Kansas, and the Monsoon '90 experiment, conducted in the semiarid rangelands of the Walnut Gulch Watershed in southern Arizona. Both comparisons yielded uncertainties comparable to those achieved by models that do require air temperature as an input and to measurement errors typical of standard micrometeorological methods for flux estimation. A strategy for applying the two-source time-integrated model on a regional or continental scale is briefly outlined.},

The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. -from Authors},

abstract = {In this paper, a hydrologic/hydrodynamic modeling of the Amazon River basin is presented using the MGB-IPH model with a validation using remotely sensed observations. Moreover, the sources of model errors by means of the validation and sensitivity tests are investigated, and the physical functioning of the Amazon basin is also explored. The MGB-IPH is a physically based model resolving all land hydrological processes and here using a full 1-D river hydrodynamic module with a simple floodplain storage model. River-floodplain geometry parameters were extracted from the SRTM digital elevation model, and the model was forced using satellite-derived rainfall from TRMM3B42. Model results agree with observed in situ daily river discharges and water levels and with three complementary satellite-based products: (1) water levels derived from ENVISAT altimetry data; (2) a global data set of monthly inundation extent; and (3) monthly terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experimental mission. However, the model is sensitive to precipitation forcing and river-floodplain parameters. Most of the errors occur in westerly regions, possibly due to the poor quality of TRMM 3B42 rainfall data set in these mountainous and/or poorly monitored areas. In addition, uncertainty in river-floodplain geometry causes errors in simulated water levels and inundation extent, suggesting the need for improvement of parameter estimation methods. Finally, analyses of Amazon hydrological processes demonstrate that surface waters govern most of the Amazon TWS changes (56%), followed by soil water (27%) and ground water (8%). Moreover, floodplains play a major role in stream flow routing, although backwater effects are also important to delay and attenuate flood waves. {\textcopyright}2013. American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {Deforestation and drought are among the greatest environmental pressures on the Amazon rainforest, possibly destabilizing the forest-climate system. Deforestation in the Amazon reduces rainfall regionally, while this deforestation itself has been reported to be facilitated by droughts. Here we quantify the interactions between drought and deforestation spatially across the Amazon during the early 21st century. First, we relate observed fluctuations in deforestation rates to dry-season intensity; second, we determine the effect of conversion of forest to cropland on evapotranspiration; and third, we simulate the subsequent downwind reductions in rainfall due to decreased atmospheric water input. We find large variability in the response of deforestation to dry-season intensity, with a significant but small average increase in deforestation rates with a more intense dry season: With every mm of water deficit, deforestation tends to increase by 0.13% per year. Deforestation, in turn, has caused an estimated 4% of the recent observed drying, with the south-western part of the Amazon being most strongly affected. Combining both effects, we quantify a reinforcing drought-deforestation feedback that is currently small, but becomes gradually stronger with cumulative deforestation. Our results suggest that global climate change, not deforestation, is the main driver of recent drying in the Amazon. However, a feedback between drought and deforestation implies that increases in either of them will impede efforts to curb both.},

abstract = {<p><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra (IGB) river basins provide about 900 million people with water resources used for agricultural, domestic, and industrial purposes. These river basins are marked as “climate change hotspots”, where climate change is expected to affect monsoon dynamics and the amount of meltwater from snow and ice, and thus the amount of water available. Simultaneously, rapid and continuous population growth as well as strong economic development will likely result in a rapid increase in water demand. Since quantification of these future trends is missing, it is rather uncertain how the future South Asian water gap will develop. To this end, we assess the combined impacts of climate change and socio-economic development on the future “blue” water gap in the IGB until the end of the 21st century. We apply a coupled modelling approach consisting of the distributed cryospheric–hydrological model SPHY, which simulates current and future upstream water supply, and the hydrology and crop production model LPJmL, which simulates current and future downstream water supply and demand. We force the coupled models with an ensemble of eight representative downscaled general circulation models (GCMs) that are selected from the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, and a set of land use and socio-economic scenarios that are consistent with the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) marker scenarios 1 and 3. The simulation outputs are used to analyse changes in the water availability, supply, demand, and gap. The outcomes show an increase in surface water availability towards the end of the 21st century, which can mainly be attributed to increases in monsoon precipitation. However, despite the increase in surface water availability, the strong socio-economic development and associated increase in water demand will likely lead to an increase in the water gap during the 21st century. This indicates that socio-economic development is the key driver in the evolution of the future South Asian water gap. The transgression of future environmental flows will likely be limited, with sustained environmental flow requirements during the monsoon season and unmet environmental flow requirements during the low-flow season in the Indus and Ganges river basins.</p>]]></p>},

This study presents an iterative adjustment method based on the Self-calibration Variance-Component Model (SCVCM) for spatially downscaling GRACE-derived Total Water Storage Anomaly (GRACE TWSA) from its original coarse resolution (∼300 km) to a high resolution (5 km) through integrating Land Surface Model (LSM) simulated high-resolution Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (LSM TWSA). The proposed method takes the GRACE TWSA and the LSM TWSA, which includes soil water content, snow water equivalent, and plant water, as inputs with unknown uncertainties. It then establishes an observation system to estimate the unknown TWSA at the high resolution through an iterative adjustment process based on a posteriori variance-component estimation technique. By applying the method to the coarse-resolution (∼300 km) GRACE TWSA from the JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) mascon solution and the high-resolution (5 km) LSM TWSA from the Ecological Assimilation of Land and Climate Observations (EALCO) model, we evaluated its benefit and effectiveness. The results show that the proposed method is capable to downscale GRACE TWSA with improved uncertainties. The downscaled GRACE TWSA are also evaluated through in situ groundwater monitoring well observations and the results show a certain level agreement between the estimated and observed trends.},

abstract = {Continuous observations of temporal variations in the Earth's gravity field have recently become available at an unprecedented resolution of a few hundreds of kilometers. The gravity field is a product of the Earth's mass distribution, and these data - provided by the satellites of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) - can be used to study the exchange of mass both within the Earth and at its surface. Since the launch of the mission in 2002, GRACE data has evolved from being an experimental measurement needing validation from ground truth, to a respected tool for Earth scientists representing a fixed bound on the total change and is now an important tool to help unravel the complex dynamics of the Earth system and climate change. In this review, we present the mission concept and its theoretical background, discuss the data and give an overview of the major advances GRACE has provided in Earth science, with a focus on hydrology, solid Earth sciences, glaciology and oceanography.},

In this study, we present a fast retrieval method for retrieving Tskin based on an artificial neural network (ANN) from a set of spectral channels selected from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) using the information theory/entropy reduction technique. Our IASI Tskin product (i.e., TANN) is evaluated against Tskin from EUMETSAT Level 2 product, ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA5), SEVIRI observations, and ground in situ measurements. Good correlations between IASI TANN and the Tskin from other datasets are shown by their statistic data, such as a mean bias and standard deviation (i.e., [bias, STDE]) of [0.55, 1.86 °C], [0.19, 2.10 °C], [-1.5, 3.56 °C], from EUMETSAT IASI L-2 product, ERA5, and SEVIRI. When compared to ground station data, we found that all datasets did not achieve the needed accuracy at several months of the year, and better results were achieved at nighttime. Therefore, comparison with ground-based measurements should be done with care to achieve the ±2 °C accuracy needed, by choosing, for example, a validation site near the station location. On average, this accuracy is achieved, in particular at night, leading to the ability to construct a robust Tskin dataset suitable for Tskin long-term spatio-temporal variability and trend analysis.},

abstract = {Groundwater, the largest available store of global freshwater1, is relied upon by more than two billion people2. It is therefore important to quantify the spatiotemporal interactions between groundwater and climate. However, current understanding of the global-scale sensitivity of groundwater systems to climate change3,4—as well as the resulting variation in feedbacks from groundwater to the climate system5,6—is limited. Here, using groundwater model results in combination with hydrologic data sets, we examine the dynamic timescales of groundwater system responses to climate change. We show that nearly half of global groundwater fluxes could equilibrate with recharge variations due to climate change on human ($\sim$100 year) timescales, and that areas where water tables are most sensitive to changes in recharge are also those that have the longest groundwater response times. In particular, groundwater fluxes in arid regions are shown to be less responsive to climate variability than in humid regions. Adaptation strategies must therefore account for the hydraulic memory of groundwater systems, which can buffer climate change impacts on water resources in many regions, but may also lead to a long, but initially hidden, legacy of anthropogenic and climatic impacts on river flows and groundwater-dependent ecosystems.},

By 2070–2099, the average of the models predicts a 20% decrease in land surface water availability and a 24% increase in the loss of fresh water over the Mediterranean Sea due to precipitation reduction and warming-enhanced evaporation, with a remarkably high consensus among analyzed models. The projected decrease in river runoff from the surrounding land will further exacerbate the increase inMediterranean Sea fresh water deficit. 20th century simulations indicate that the ‘transition' toward drier conditions has already started to occur and has accelerated around the turn of the century towards the larger rates projected for the 21st century. These tendencies are supported by observational evidence of century-long negative trends in regionally averaged precipitation, PDSI and discharge from numerous rivers; and are consistent with reported increases in Mediterranean sea water salinity.},

abstract = {Study region: Upper Madeira Basin (975,500 km2) in Southern Amazonia, which is suffering a biophysical transition, involving deforestation and changes in rainfall regime. Study focus: The evolution of the runoff coefficient (Rc: runoff/rainfall) is examined as an indicator of the environmental changes (1982–2017). New hydrological insights for the region: At an annual scale, the Rc at Porto Velho station declines while neither the basin-averaged rainfall nor the runoff change. During the low-water period Rc and runoff diminish while no changes are observed in rainfall. This cannot be explained by increase of evapotranspiration since the basin-averaged actual evapotranspiration decreases. To explain the decrease of Rc, a regional analysis is undertaken. While the characteristic rainfall-runoff time-lag (CT) at Porto Velho basin is estimated to 60 days, CT is higher (65–75 days) in the south and lower (50 days) over the Amazon-Andes transition regions. It is found that 1) the southern basin (south of 14 °S) best explains low-level Porto Velho runoff, 2) in the south, rainfall diminishes and the frequency of dry days increases. Both features explain the diminution of the runoff and the Rc in Porto Velho. Moreover, the increasing dryness in the south compensates for the rainfall and frequency of wet days (>10 mm) increase north of 14 °S and explains the lack of basin-averaged rainfall trends of the upper Madeira basin.},

abstract = {We introduce a simple biophysical model for surface conductance, G s, for use with remotely sensed leaf area index (Lai) data and the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation to calculate daily average evaporation, E, at kilometer spatial resolution. The model for Gs has six parameters that represent canopy physiological processes and soil evaporation: gsx, maximum stomatal conductance; Q50 and D50, the values of solar radiation and atmospheric humidity deficit when the stomatal conductance is half its maximum; kQ and kA, extinction coefficients for visible radiation and available energy; and f, the ratio of soil evaporation to the equilibrium rate corresponding to the energy absorbed at the soil surface. Model parameters were estimated using 2-3 years of data from 15 flux station sites covering a wide range of climate and vegetation types globally. The PM estimates of E are best when all six parameters in the Gs model are optimized at each site, but there is no significant reduction in model performance when Q50, D50, k Q, and kA are held constant across sites and g sx and f are optimized (linear regression of modeled mean daily evaporation versus measurements: slope = 0.83, intercept = 0.22 mm/d, R 2 = 0.80, and N = 10623). The average systematic root-mean-square error in daytime mean evaporation was 0.27 mm/d (range 0.09-0.50 mm/d) for the 15 sites. The average unsystematic component was 0.48 mm/d (range 0.28-0.71 mm/d). The new model for Gs with two parameters yields better estimates of E than an earlier, simple model Gs = cL Lai, where cL is an optimized parameter. Our study confirms that the PM equation provides reliable estimates of evaporation rates from land surfaces at daily time scales and kilometer space scales when remotely sensed leaf area indices are incorporated into a simple biophysical model for surface conductance. Developing remote sensing techniques to measure the temporal and spatial variation in f is expected to enhance the utility of the model proposed in this paper.

abstract = {A two-parameter annual water balance model was developed for reconstructing annual terrestrial water storage change ($\Delta$TWS) and groundwater storage change ($\Delta$GWS). The model was integrated with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and applied to the Punjab province in Pakistan for reconstructing $\Delta$TWS and $\Delta$GWS during 1980–2015 based on multiple input data sources. Model parameters were estimated through minimizing the root-mean-square error between the Budyko-modeled and GRACE-derived $\Delta$TWS during 2003–2015. The correlation of ensemble means between Budyko-modeled and GRACE-derived $\Delta$TWS is 0.68 with p-value <0.05. The $\Delta$GWS was reconstructed by subtracting soil moisture storage change from the Budyko-modeled $\Delta$TWS and was validated (i.e., r = 0.74, p-value < 0.05) against well observations during the pre-GRACE period (i.e., 1985–1994). The negative values of the cumulative sum of the reconstructed $\Delta$GWS during 1980–2015 (i.e., −13.6 ± 9.7 cm) indicate that the aquifer in Punjab has experienced depletion. The estimated depletion rate is −0.3 ± 0.2 cm/year and it has a negative correlation (i.e., r = −0.70, p-value < 0.0001) with the total number of tube wells installed in Punjab.

abstract = {<p>    Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is currently producing the ERA5 reanalysis which embodies a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis will replace the highly successful ERA-Interim reanalysis that was started in 2006 (spanning 1979 onwards), and will also encompass the period covered by ERA-40. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cycle 41r2 which was operational in 2016. Therefore, ERA5 benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, numerics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31km, compared to 80kmfor ERA-Interim, ERA5 has a number of innovative features. These include hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). The step forward regarding quality and level of detail is evident. Forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim.</p>    <p>    One important novelty of ERA5 is the availability within 5 days of real time which will serve users that need recent meteorological information in combination with a long and consistent climate record. Such guaranteed timeliness requires that the ERA5 reanalysis is generated as an operational product.</p>    <p>    The operational services in the Copernicus Programme build upon the massive European investments in mature science and technology. For climate reanalysis, this is a two-way interaction for ECMWF. On the one hand, ERA5 benefits greatly from the leverage of the developments in the IFS. On the other hand, the operational model development at ECMWF benefits from reanalysis. One excellent example of this is the Research and Development work performed within the European-Commission funded research projects ERA-CLIM and ERA-CLIM2.</p>    <p>    This paper provides an overview of ECMWF's atmospheric, ocean and land reanalysis activities. In particular, it presents the ERA5 reanalysis system and its performance. It also describes challenges that were encountered and their practical solutions. The outcomes of the ERA-CLIM and ERACLIM2 projects will be summarized. Subsequent developments in, and plans for, the IFS in support of future reanalyses, aligned with the ECMWF strategy, are described.</p>},

abstract = {SIM-France is a large connected atmosphere/land surface/river/groundwater modelling system that simulates the water cycle throughout metropolitan France. The work presented in this study investigates the replacement of the river routing scheme in SIM-France by a river network model called RAPID to enhance the capacity to relate simulated flows to river gauges and to take advantage of the automated parameter estimation procedure of RAPID. RAPID was run with SIM-France over a 10-year period and results compared with those of the previous river routing scheme. We found that while the formulation of RAPID enhanced the functionality of SIM-France, the flow simulations are comparable in accuracy to those previously obtained by SIM-France. Sub-basin optimization of RAPID parameters was found to increase model efficiency. A single criterion for quantifying the quality of river flow simulations using several river gauges globally in a river network is developed that normalizes the square error of modelled flow to allow equal treatment of all gauging stations regardless of the magnitude of flow. The use of this criterion as the cost function for parameter estimation in RAPID allows better results than by increasing the degree of spatial variability in optimization of model parameters. Likewise, increased spatial variability of RAPID parameters through accounting for topography is shown to enhance model performance. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {This study is a geochemical investigation of the Andean and Foreland basins of the Amazon River at high spatial and time resolution, carried out within the framework of the HYBAM research program (Hydro-geodynamics of the Amazon Basin). Monthly sampling was carried out at 27 gauging stations located in the upper tributaries of the Amazon Basin (from north to south: the Napo, Mara{\~{n}}on, Ucayali, Madre de Dios-Beni and Mamore Rivers). The aim of this paper is to estimate the present-day chemical weathering rate (CWR), as well as the flux of CO2 consumption from total and silicate weathering in the Andes and Foreland Amazon basins, and to discuss their distribution as a function of geomorphic and structural parameters. Based on the forward method, the Napo and other Ecuadorian basins present high silicate weathering rates in comparison with the other basins. We confirm that the Mara{\~{n}}on and Ucayali Rivers control the Amazon hydrochemistry due to the presence of salt rocks and carbonates in these basins. The Madre de Dios, Beni and Mamore basins do not contribute much to the Amazon dissolved load. This north to south CWR gradient can be explained by the combination of decreasing weatherable lithology surface and decreasing runoff rates from the north to the south. The foreland part of the basins (or Mountain-Lowland transition) accounts for nearly the same proportion of the Amazon silicate chemical weathering and carbonate chemical weathering fluxes as the Andean part. This result demonstrates the importance of the sediment accumulation areas in the Amazon Basin weathering budget and can be explained by the occurrence of a higher temperature, the deposition of fresh sediments from Andean erosion and a higher sediment residence time than in the upper part of the basin. With a total CO2 consumption rate of 744.103moleskm-2year-1 and a silicate CO2 consumption rate of 300.103moleskm-2year-1, the Upper Amazon River (Andes+Foreland part) is the most intense part of the Amazon Basin in terms of atmospheric CO2 consumption by weathering processes. It is an important CO2 sink by weathering processes but accounts for only somewhat more than half of the CO2 consumption by silicate weathering of the Amazon Basin. This result points out the importance of the Lowland part of the basin in the inorganic C silicate budget. The Upper Amazon accounts for 2-4% of the world's silicate CO2 consumption, which is the same proportion as for the southern and southern-east Himalaya and Tibetan plateau. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {[Nimbus 7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) measurements at five frequencies in the region 6.6 to 37 GHz, at a resolution of 155 km, are analyzed to infer precipitation over the global oceans. The microwave data show, on this spatial scale, that the combined liquid water in the clouds and rain increases the brightness temperature almost linearly with frequency in the 6.6 to 18 GHz region, while at 37 GHz such a simple relationship is not noticed. Further, as the atmospheric water vapor absorption and the effects of scattering by precipitation particles are relatively weak at 6.6 and 10.7 GHz, a technique to remotely sense the liquid water content in the atmosphere is developed based on the brightness measurements at these two frequencies. Seasonal mean patterns of liquid water content in the atmosphere derived from SMMR over global oceans relate closely to climatological patterns of precipitation. Based on this, an empirical relationship is derived to estimate precipitation over the global oceans, with an accuracy of about ±30 percent, on a seasonal basis from satellite measurements made during the three years (1979–81) before the recent El Ni{\~{n}}o event. The deviations from these three-year means, in the precipitation, produced by the 1982–83 El Ni{\~{n}}o event are then deduced from the SMMR measurements. In the Pacific one notices from these deviations that the precipitation over the ITCZ in the north, the South Pacific Convergence Zone, and the oceans around Indonesia is drastically reduced. At the same time a substantial increase in precipitation is observed over the normally dry central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.]},

The last 10 years have featured various " once in a century " droughts and floods in the Amazon basin, which have affected human and natural systems in the region. We assess a history of such hazards based on river data, and discuss some of the observed impacts in terms of vulnerability of human and natural systems, as well as some of adaptation strategies implemented by regional and local governments to cope with them. A critical perspective of mitigation of drought and flood policies in Amazonia suggests that they have been mostly ineffective in reducing vulnerability for the majority of the population, constituting, perhaps, exam-ples of maladaptation via the undermining of resilience.},

abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to examine the temporal and spatial variability of the troposphere over the Southern Hemisphere and, in the case of El Nino/Southern Oscillation, link it to fluctuations in the tropical oceans as well. In the time since the first volume on Southern Hemisphere meteorology appeared in 1972, it has been possible to examine in much more detail the variability of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) atmosphere, due to the vast improvements in the amount and quality of data that have since become available. Despite this progress, vast regions of the southern oceans remain very poorly observed. Fortunately, advances in remote sensing by satellite have done much to fill in some of the existing gaps in the ship-and ground-based observing network. We deal specifically here with interannual (IA) and intraseasonal (IS) variability, with respect to the mean state of the atmosphere as outlined in sections 1 and 2. As discussed in those sections, over most regions the SH atmosphere displays a lower amplitude mean seasonal cycle than does the Northern Hemisphere, where continental effects result in a much larger first annual harmonic in the meridional temperature gradient and circulation strength. This is also reflected in less of a seasonal dependence in the variability of the SH troposphere. Despite the dominance of ocean over the SH, however, continental effects, orography, and forcing from the Tropics still produce substantial zonal asymmetries in both the time-mean flow and statistics of IA and IS variability.},

While the developers have performed verification and validation, there is little information on their relative performance in particular related to their use in ocean modeling. This study focuses on the intercomparison of wind speeds and wave heights from ERA-I and CFSR utilizing the same set of altimetry and buoy observations and error metrics to assess their consistency in time and space. Both products have good spatial homogeneity with consistent levels of errors in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. ERA-I proves to be homogenous through time, while CFSR exhibits an abrupt decrease in the level of errors in the Southern Ocean beginning 1994. ERA-I generally underestimates the wind speed and wave height with lower standard deviations in comparison to observations, but maintains slightly better error metrics. Despite having a small positive bias, CFSR provides a better description of the variability of the observations and improved performance in the upper percentiles associated with extreme events. Overall ERA-I has better homogeneity through time deeming it more reliable for modeling of long-term processes; however caution must be applied with analysis of the upper percentiles. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

One year (August 1998-July 1999) of tropical rainfall estimates from the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) systems were used to produce monthly means of rainfall diurnal cycles at hourly and 1° × 1° scales over a domain (30°S-30°N, 80°E-10°W) from the Americas across the Pacific Ocean to Australia and eastern Asia. The results demonstrate pronounced diurnal variability of tropical rainfall intensity at synoptic and regional scales. Seasonal signals of diurnal rainfall are presented over the large domain of the tropical Pacific Ocean, especially over the ITCZ and South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) and neighboring continents. The regional patterns of tropical rainfall diurnal cycles are specified in the Amazon, Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, Calcutta, Bay of Bengal, Malaysia, and northern Australia. Limited validations for the results include comparisons of 1) the PERSIANN-derived diurnal cycle of rainfall at Rondonia, Brazil, with that derived from the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) radar data; 2) the PERSIANN diurnal cycle of rainfall over the western Pacific Ocean with that derived from the data of the optical rain gauges mounted on the TOGA-moored buoys: and 3) the monthly accumulations of rainfall samples from the orbital TMI and PR surface rainfall with the accumulations of concurrent PERSIANN estimates. These comparisons indicate that the PERSIANN-derived diurnal patterns at the selected resolutions produce estimates that are similar in magnitude and phase.},

abstract = {This study investigated the potential of assessing the water balance in South America, at multiple scales, using satellite remote sensing precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets, terrestrial water storage changes from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and discharge measurements. The remote sensing precipitation datasets included those of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), whilst the ET constituents included the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). Uncertainties in precipitation and ET were evaluated using in situ measurements of 307 rain-gauge stations and 16 eddy covariance sites, respectively. The water balance closure and uncertainties were evaluated in 50 basins for the period 2003–2014, at different spatial scales and under different climatic conditions. Overall, MSWEP precipitation and GLEAM ET provided fewer uncertainties, whilst TRMM and MOD16 yielded greater bias and more errors. Better agreements between the TWSC from GRACE and the water balance were found in the large and medium-sized basins, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 42%, whilst small basins and those located in regions with subtropical humid climates, where precipitation did not present strong seasonality, had a RMSE around 130%, indicating that climate conditions can influence the water balance closure. The TWSC from GRACE and the remote sensing water balance estimations were in agreement for more than half of the evaluated basins, mainly those located in tropical climate regions. Greater bias and more errors were found in the estimations of discharge in the semi-arid basins, with low runoff coefficients. Despite the water balance based on remote sensing estimations remaining a challenge due to the large uncertainties in precipitation, ET, and TWSC, our results showed their great potential for assessing terrestrial water-cycle dynamics and understanding their spatial and temporal variability at multiple scales.},

This paradigm imposes that errors are transferred from runoff to discharge, yet the analytical propagation of uncertainty from runoff to discharge has never been derived. Here we apply statistics to the continuity equation within a river network to derive two equations that propagate the mean and variance/covariance of runoff errors independently. We validate these equations in a case study of the rivers in the western United States and, for the first time, invert observed discharge errors for spatially distributed runoff errors. Our results suggest that the largest discharge error source is the joint variability of runoff errors across space, not the mean or amplitude of individual errors. Our findings significantly advance the science of error quantification in model-based estimates of river discharge.},

abstract = {The present study focuses on the impacts of extreme drought and flooding situations in Amazonia, using level/discharge data from some rivers in the Amazon region as indicators of impacts. The last 10 years have featured various " once in a century " droughts and floods in the Amazon basin, which have affected human and natural systems in the region. We assess a history of such hazards based on river data, and discuss some of the observed impacts in terms of vulnerability of human and natural systems, as well as some of adaptation strategies implemented by regional and local governments to cope with them. A critical perspective of mitigation of drought and flood policies in Amazonia suggests that they have been mostly ineffective in reducing vulnerability for the majority of the population, constituting, perhaps, exam-ples of maladaptation via the undermining of resilience.},

abstract = {We discuss the claim that the Amazon River has been subjected to a noticeable increase in suspended sediment transport (SST) in response to both climate and land-use changes. To study this, both satellite imagery and in situ data were compiled to produce a 32-year time series (1984–2016) of suspended sediment concentration. Both parametric and nonparametric statistics were applied to examine the SST time trend. The results indicate that there has been no statistically significant increase in SST in the last 32 years, independent of the statistical approach. The results indicate that, over the last 32 years at the {\'{O}}bidos station, in Brazil, a recurring pattern of increase and decrease in SST has occurred, rather than a unidirectional systematic trend. This further explains the increasing trend reported in the literature and indicates that short time series are not recommended for time trend analyses due to the large inter-annual variability.},

abstract = {<p>Despite their potential influences on surface water and climate, groundwater processes are generally not represented in climate models. Here, a simple groundwater scheme including two-dimensional flow dynamics and accounting for groundwater–river exchanges is introduced into the global Total Runoff Integrated Pathways (TRIP) river routing model coupled to the M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}o-France climate model. This original scheme is tested in offline mode over France at high ([Formula: see text]) and low (0.5°) resolution against a dense network of river discharge and water table observations over the 1970–2010 period, and is compared to the fine-tuned Syst{\`{e}}me d'Analyze Fournissant des Renseignements Atmosph{\'{e}}riques {\`{a}} la Neige (SAFRAN)–Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere (ISBA) coupled hydrometeorological model (MODCOU). In addition, the simulated terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations are compared to the TWS estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. The aquifer basins over France are defined using the World-wide Hydrogeological Mapping and Assessment Programme (WHYMAP) groundwater resources map, a simplified French lithological map, and the International Geological Map of Europe (IGME). TRIP is forced by daily runoff and drainage data derived from a preexisting simulation of the ISBA land surface scheme driven by the high-resolution SAFRAN meteorological analysis. Four simulations are carried out with or without groundwater at both resolutions. Results show that the groundwater scheme allows TRIP to better capture the spatiotemporal variability of the observed river discharges and piezometric heads. Summer base flows are particularly improved over the main rivers of France. Decreasing the horizontal resolution has a limited impact on the simulated discharges, while it slightly degrades the simulation of water table variations.</p>},

Ground measurements are complicated due to detection technology limitations, snow drift and accumulation issues, and error definition. The snowfall detection from space is in turn affected by all detection limitations that characterize the measurement of rainfall with the addition of several complications, such as the indirect character of remote sensing precipitation estimation, the presence of frozen or snow-covered terrain, and the unknown vertical distribution of hydrometeors in the cloud column. Several methods for the retrieval of snowfall intensity from satellite have been proposed in recent times using passive and active sensors. No satisfactory answer to the general problem of quantitative snowfall intensity determination has been found to date, but several studies contribute to delineate a working framework for the future operational retrieval algorithms.},

abstract = {The mass change information from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission is available in terms of noisy spherical harmonic coefficients truncated at a maximum degree (band-limited). Therefore, filtering is an inevitable step in post-processing of GRACE fields to extract meaningful information about mass redistribution in the Earth-system. It is well known from previous studies that a number can be allotted to the spatial resolution of a band-limited spherical harmonic spectrum and also to a filtered field. Furthermore, it is now a common practice to correct the filtered GRACE data for signal damage due to filtering (or convolution in the spatial domain). These correction methods resemble deconvolution, and, therefore, the spatial resolution of the corrected GRACE data have to be reconsidered. Therefore, the effective spatial resolution at which we can obtain mass changes from GRACE products is an area of debate. In this contribution, we assess the spatial resolution both theoretically and practically. We confirm that, theoretically, the smallest resolvable catchment is directly related to the band-limit of the spherical harmonic spectrum of the GRACE data. However, due to the approximate nature of the correction schemes and the noise present in GRACE data, practically, the complete band-limited signal cannot be retrieved. In this context, we perform a closed-loop simulation comparing four popular correction schemes over 255 catchments to demarcate the minimum size of the catchment whose signal can be efficiently recovered by the correction schemes. We show that the amount of closure error is inversely related to the size of the catchment area. We use this trade-off between the error and the catchment size for defining the potential spatial resolution of the GRACE product obtained from a correction method. The magnitude of the error and hence the spatial resolution are both dependent on the correction scheme. Currently, a catchment of the size ≈63,000 km2 can be resolved at an error level of 2 cm in terms of equivalent water height.},

abstract = {In companion paper 1, the SAtellite Water Cycle (SAWC) satellite data set integration approach was presented. SAWC accounts for (1) the closure of the water budget at the sub-basin scale by (2) using upstream/downstream dependencies. Here, the SAWC database is used to reconstruct a missing water component. The total water storage change (dS) can be reconstructed prior to the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) period. In terms of seasonal and interannual variations, SAWC provides long-term dS estimates that are highly consistent with the GRACE estimate (2002–2015). When compared to the extent of inundation, correlation of anomalies reaches 0.6 over sub-basins presenting large floodplain. A strong relationship (correlation of 0.7) exists between the monthly dS and the El Ni{\~{n}}o index. The river discharge R can also be estimated using the SAWC approach during the GRACE period. A scheme was developed to estimate R continuously along the river through the indirect interpolation of discharge station measurements by using satellite estimates of dS, precipitation P, and evaporation E. These R estimates along the river were evaluated with 80 independent measurements and had a correlation of 0.86 and a Kling-Gupta efficiency index of 0.71. A comprehensive monthly river discharge estimate was proposed for the first time across the Amazon basin over 13 years (2002–2015) at a 0.25° resolution. The SAWC framework is a pure observation tool for integrating a large range of satellite estimates, potentially facilitating the assimilation of such data into land surface models.},

Here, we show that an amplified seasonal cycle of Amazonia precipitation, represented by the annual difference between maximum and minimum values, during the period 1979–2018, leads to enhanced seasonalities in both Amazon river discharge and APR ocean salinity. An atmospheric moisture budget analysis shows that these enhanced seasonal cycles are associated with similar amplifications in the atmospheric vertical and horizontal moisture advections. Hierarchical sensitivity experiments using global climate models quantify the relationships of these enhanced seasonalities. The results suggest that an intensified hydroclimatological cycle may develop in the Amazonia atmosphere-land-ocean coupled system, favouring more extreme terrestrial and marine conditions.},

abstract = {This study sets out to analyze the stages of water bodies in the Amazon basin derived from the processing of ERS-2 and ENVISAT satellite altimetry data. For ENVISAT, GDR measurements for both Ice-1 and Ice-2 tracking algorithms were tested. For ERS-2, the Ice-2 data produced by the OSCAR project was used. Water level time series over river segments of very different width, from several kilometers to less than a hundred of meters, were studied. The water level time series that can be derived from narrow riverbeds are enhanced by off-nadir detections. Conversely, the off-nadir effect may degrade the series over large bodies if not properly accounted for. Comparison at crossovers and with in situ gauges shows that the quality of the series can be highly variable, from 12. cm in the best cases and 40. cm in most cases to several meters in the worse cases. Cautious data selection is clearly a key point to achieve high quality series. Indeed, low quality series mostly result from inclusion of outliers in the data set finally retained for the computation of the series. Ice-2 and Ice-1 tracking algorithms in the ENVISAT data perform almost equally well. ENVISAT altimetry is clearly an improvement on ERS-2 altimetry. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of global connections between interannual TWS changes and El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, using multiple sources of data, including GRACE measurements, land surface model (LSM) predictions and precipitation observations. We use cross-correlation and coherence spectrum analysis to examine global connections between interannual TWS changes and the Ni{\~{n}}o 3.4 index, and select four river basins (Amazon, Orinoco, Colorado, and Lena) for more detailed analysis. The results indicate that interannual TWS changes are strongly correlated with ENSO over much of the globe, with maximum cross-correlation coefficients up to $\sim$0.70, well above the 95% significance level ($\sim$0.29) derived by the Monte Carlo experiments. The strongest correlations are found in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in the Amazon, Orinoco, and La Plata basins. While both GRACE and LSM TWS estimates show reasonably good correlations with ENSO and generally consistent spatial correlation patterns, notably higher correlations are found between GRACE TWS and ENSO. The existence of significant correlations in middle–high latitudes shows the large-scale impact of ENSO on the global water cycle.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal variability of total column ozone ($\Omega$) obtained from the total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS version 7.0) during the period 1980-1992 was examined through the use of a multivariate statistical technique called rotated principal component analysis. Utilization of Kaiser's varimax orthogonal rotation led to the identification of 14, mostly contiguous subregions that together accounted for more than 70% of the total $\Omega$ variance. Each subregion displayed statistically unique $\Omega$ characteristics that were further examined through time series and spectral density analyses, revealing significant periodicities on semiannual, annual, quasi-biennial, and longer term time frames. This analysis facilitated identification of the probable mechanisms responsible for the variability of $\Omega$ within the 14 homogeneous subregions. The mechanisms were either dynamical in nature (i.e., advection associated with baroclinic waves, the quasi-biennial oscillation, or El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation) or photochemical in nature (i.e., production of odd oxygen (O or O3) associated with the annual progression of the Sun). The analysis has also revealed that the influence of a data retrieval artifact, found in equatorial latitudes of version 6.0 of the TOMS data, has been reduced in version 7.0.},

This empirical conclusion seemingly refutes previous decades of research defining AHG as spatially independent and site specific. Furthermore, AMHG was the centerpiece of an unprecedented recent methodology that successfully estimated river discharge solely from satellite imagery. Despite these important implications, AMHG has remained an empirical phenomenon without theoretical explanation. Here we provide the mathematical basis for AMHG, showing that it arises when independent AHG curves within a reach intersect near the same values of discharge and width, depth, or velocity. The strength of observed AMHG is determined by the degree of this convergence. Finally, we show that AMHG enables discharge estimation by defining a set of possible estimated discharges that often match true discharges and propose its future interpretation as a fluvial index.},

abstract = {A Kalman filter (KF)-based Climate Prediction Center (CPC) morphing technique (CMORPH) algorithm is developed to integrate the passive microwave (PMW) precipitation estimates from low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and infrared (IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) platforms. With the new algorithm, the precipitation analysis at a grid box of 8 × 8 km 2 is defined in three steps. First, PMW estimates of instantaneous rain rates closest to the target analysis time in both the forward and backward directions are propagated from their observation times to the analysis time using the cloud system advection vectors (CSAVs) computed from the GEO-IR images. The "prediction" of the precipitation analysis is then defined by averaging the forward- and backward-propagated PMW estimates with weights inversely proportional to their error variance. The IR-based precipitation estimates are incorporated if the gap between the two PMW observations is longer than 90 min. Validation tests showed substantial improvements of the KF-based CMORPH against the original version in both the pattern correlation and fidelity of probability density function (PDF) of the precipitation intensity. In general, performance of the original CMORPH degrades sharply with poor pattern correlation and substantially elevated (damped) frequency for light (heavy) precipitation events when PMW precipitation estimates are available from fewer LEO satellites.

abstract = {The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission provides time-variable gravity fields that are commonly used to study regional and global terrestrial total water storage (TWS) changes. These estimates are superimposed by different error sources such as the north–south stripes in the spatial domain and spectral/spatial leakage errors, which should be reduced before use in hydrological applications. Although different filtering methods have been developed to mitigate these errors, their performances are known to vary between regions. In this study, a Kernel Fourier Integration (KeFIn) filter is proposed, which can significantly decrease leakage errors over (small) river basins through a two-step post-processing algorithm. The first step mitigates the measurement noise and the aliasing of unmodelled high-frequency mass variations, and the second step contains an efficient kernel to decrease the leakage errors. To evaluate its performance, the KeFIn filter is compared with commonly used filters based on (i) basin/gridded scaling factors and (ii) ordinary basin averaging kernels. Two test scenarios are considered that include synthetic data with properties similar to GRACE TWS estimates within 43 globally distributed river basins of various sizes and application of the filters on real GRACE data. The KeFIn filter is assessed against water flux observations through the water balance equations as well as in-situ measurements. Results of both tests indicate a remarkable improvement after applying the KeFIn filter with leakage errors reduced in 34 out of the 43 assessed river basins and an average improvement of about 23.38% in leakage error reduction compared to other filters applied in this study.},

abstract = {Terrestrial water storage is an essential part of the hydrological cycle, encompassing crucial elements of the climate system, such as soil moisture, groundwater, snow, and land ice. On a regional scale, it is however not a readily measured variable and observations of its individual components are scarce. This study investigates the feasability of estimating monthly terrestrial water-storage variations from water-balance computations, using the following three variables: water vapor flux convergence, atmospheric water vapor content, and river runoff. The two first variables are available with high resolution and good accuracy in the present reanalysis datasets, and river runoff is commonly measured in most parts of the world. The applicability of this approach is tested in a 10-yr (1987–96) case study for the Mississippi River basin. Data used include European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 40-yr reanalysis (ERA-40) data (water vapor flux and atmospheric water vapor content) and runoff observations from the United States Geological Survey. Results are presented for the whole Mississippi River basin and its subbasins, and for a smaller domain covering Illinois, where direct measurements of the main components of the terrestrial water storage (soil moisture, groundwater level, and snow cover) are available. The water-balance estimates of monthly terrestrial water-storage variations show excellent agreement with observations taken over Illinois. The mean seasonal cycle, as well as interannual variations, are captured with notable accuracy. Despite this excellent agreement, it is not straightforward to integrate the computed variations over longer time periods, because there are small systematic biases in the monthly changes. These biases likely result from inaccuracies of the atmospheric assimilation system used to estimate the atmospheric water vapor convergence and can be corrected in part with the application of a simple detrending procedure. It is noteworthy that the critical domain size for water-balance computations, using high-resolution reanalysis data such as ERA-40, appears to be much smaller than for raw radiosonde data. The Illinois domain has a size of only ϳ2 ϫ 10 5 km 2 and is shown to be suitable for the computation of the water-balance estimates. A comparison for other regions would be needed in order to confirm this result.},

abstract = {A small field campaign was conducted during August 1997 in the Piano di Rosia area in Tuscany, Italy. The terms of both the radiation balance and the surface energy balance were measured by several techniques and for several field sites. Together with a LANDSAT-TM scene of 23 August 1997 of the same area, these data give an excellent opportunity for a profound study of interaction between the radiation and energy fluxes from point to regional scale. A new method to derive the surface energy fluxes from remote sensing measurements, called the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI), is developed, tested and validated with the available data. If the atmospheric conditions over the area can be considered constant and the area reflects sufficient variations in surface hydrological conditions the fluxes can be calculated without any further information than the remote sensing image itself. The results of this case study show that with the relative simple S-SEBI method the surface energy balance parameters can be estimated with a high precision. The measured and estimated evaporative fraction values have a maximum relative difference of 8%.},

For ENVISAT, GDR measurements for both Ice-1 and Ice-2 tracking algorithms were tested. For ERS-2, the Ice-2 data produced by the OSCAR project was used. Water level time series over river segments of very different width, from several kilometers to less than a hundred of meters, were studied. The water level time series that can be derived from narrow riverbeds are enhanced by off-nadir detections. Conversely, the off-nadir effect may degrade the series over large bodies if not properly accounted for. Comparison at crossovers and with in situ gauges shows that the quality of the series can be highly variable, from 12. cm in the best cases and 40. cm in most cases to several meters in the worse cases. Cautious data selection is clearly a key point to achieve high quality series. Indeed, low quality series mostly result from inclusion of outliers in the data set finally retained for the computation of the series. Ice-2 and Ice-1 tracking algorithms in the ENVISAT data perform almost equally well. ENVISAT altimetry is clearly an improvement on ERS-2 altimetry. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The combination of active and passivemicrowave sensors on board the Tropical RainfallMeasuringMission (TRMM) satellite have been used to construct observationally constrained databases of precipitation profiles for use in passive microwave rainfall retrieval algorithms over oceans. The method uses a very conservative approach that begins with the operational TRMMprecipitation radar algorithmand adjusts its solution only as necessary to simultaneously match the radiometer observations. Where the TRMMprecipitation radar (PR) indicates no rain, an optimal estimation procedure using TRMMMicrowave Imager (TMI) radiances is used to retrieve nonraining parameters. The optimal estimationmethodology ensures that the geophysical parameters are fully consistentwith the observed radiances.Within raining fields of view, cloud-resolvingmodel outputs are matched to the liquid and frozen hydrometeor profiles retrieved by the TRMMPR. The profiles constructed in this manner are subsequently used to compute brightness temperatures that are immediately compared to coincident observations from TMI. Adjustments are made to the rainwater and ice concentrations derived by PR in order to achieve agreement at 19 and 85 GHz, vertically polarized brightness temperatures at monthly time scales.The database is generated only in the central 11 pixels of thePRradar scan, and the rain adjustment is performed independently for distinct sea surface temperature (SST) and total precipitable water (TPW) values.Overall, the procedure increases PR rainfall by 4.2%, but the adjustment is not uniform across all SST andTPWregimes.Rainfall differences range fromaminimumof257%for SSTof 293 KandTPWof 13 mmto a maximum of153%for SST of 293 K and TPWof 45 mm. These biases are generally reproduced by a TMI retrieval algorithm that uses the observationally generated database. The algorithm increases rainfall by 5.0% over the PRsolutionwith aminimumof299%for SST of 293 KandTPWof 14 mmto amaximumof111.8% for an SST of 294 K and TPWof 50 mm.

We use state-of-the-art models to simulate land surface processes and river dynamics and to separate TWS into its main components. Based on a proposed impact index, we show that surface water storage (SWS) contributes 8% of TWS variability globally, but that contribution differs widely among climate zones. Changes in SWS are a principal component of TWS variability in the tropics, where major rivers flow over arid regions and at high latitudes. SWS accounts for $\sim$22–27% of TWS variability in both the Amazon and Nile Basins. Changes in SWS are negligible in the Western U.S., Northern Africa, Middle East, and central Asia. Based on comparisons with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-based TWS, we conclude that accounting for SWS improves simulated TWS in most of South America, Africa, and Southern Asia, confirming that SWS is a key component of TWS variability.},

abstract = {The long term variability (1962-2000) of the Black Sea physical processes (e.g. temperature, main circulation, cold intermediate layer, sea level) and its relation to atmospheric conditions and large scale climate patterns are investigated using an eddy-resolving tridimensional model in combination with statistical tools (e.g. Empirical Orthogonal Functions, Self Organizing Maps). First, the ability of the model to represent the interannual dynamics of the system is assessed by comparing the modeled and satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level anomaly (SLA) decomposed into their dominant Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs). The correlation between the spatial and temporal EOFs modes derived from model and satellite data is usually satisfactory and this gives some confidence in using the model as a tool to investigate not only the SST and SLA dynamics but also the dynamics of connected variables.Then, the long term variability (1962-2000) of the Black Sea hydrodynamics is assessed by decomposing into their dominant EOFs modeled SST, SLA and selected key hydrodynamical variables associated to the main circulation and vertical structure of the water column. Significant correlations between the EOFs associated to these variables are investigated in order to link the variability of surface fields and the internal dynamics of the system.In particular, the intensity of the general cyclonic circulation (the Rim Current) is shown to impact strongly (1) the mean sea level, (2) the SST response to air temperature (AT), (3) the formation of the cold intermediate layer, (4) the meridional repartition of the SST anomaly and (5) the exchanges of heat between the north-western shelf and the open basin.In order to appraise the variability of atmospheric conditions over the Black Sea during 1962-2000 and their role in driving the hydrodynamics, a self-organizing maps technique is used to identify spatial recurrent patterns of atmospheric fields (i.e., AT, wind stress and curl).The impact on these patterns of large scale climatic variability over the north Atlantic, Eurasia and the Pacific Ocean (estimated by respectively the north Atlantic oscillation (NAO), the east Atlantic/west Russia oscillation (EA/WR) and the El Ni{\~{n}}o southern oscillation (ENSO) indexes) is assessed. Distinct time scales of influence of the large scale teleconnection patterns on the AT are identified: EA/WR drives the short scale (1-5 years) variations of SST, while the long term (>5 years) trends of the NAO drive the long term SST trends.The drastic changes that have occurred in the Black Sea deep sea ecosystem at the end of the 80s are connected to an intensification of the general circulation that has promoted an export of riverine materials from the eutrophicated north-western shelf to the deep sea.Finally, in the last two decades, we find an increased duration of persistent atmospheric anomalies regime that has the potential to drive the system away from its average state as occurred in the late 80s. If persistent in the future, such long lasting atmospheric anomalies may have a significant impact on the ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Flow directions were determined from vector data of river channels and river pathways available in two recent atlases; however, an automatic procedure using a digital elevation map of the corresponding horizontal resolution was used as a first guess. In this way, a template to convert the river discharge data into mean runoff per unit area of the basin has been obtained.

abstract = {During the past decades large-scale models have been developed to simulate global and continental terrestrial water cycles. It is an open question whether thesemodels are suitable to capture hydrological drought, in terms of runoff, on a global scale. Amultimodel ensemble analysis was carried out to evaluate if 10 such large-scalemodels agree on major drought events during the second half of the twentieth century. Time series of monthly precipitation, monthly total runofffrom 10 global hydrologicalmodels, and their ensemblemedian have been used to identify drought. Temporal development of area in drought for various regions across the globe was investigated. Model spread was largest in regions with low runoffand smallest in regions with high runoff. In vast regions, correlation between runoffdrought derived from the models and meteorological drought was found to be low. This indicated that models add information to the signal derived from precipitation and that runoffdrought cannot directly be determined from precipitation data alone in global drought analyses with a constant aggregation period. However, duration and spatial extent of major drought events differed between models. Some models showed a fast runoffresponse to rainfall, which led to deviations from reported drought events in slowly responding hydrological systems. By using an ensemble of models, this fast runoffresponse was partly overcome and delay in drought propagating from meteorological drought to drought in runoffwas included. Finally, an ensemble of models also allows for consideration of uncertainty associated with individual model structures. ? 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Adequate and accurate hydrological data is necessary to manage water resources, which are critical in developing countries where such information is limited. In recent years, global reanalysis datasets have been developed to provide this information in climatic fields and, more recently, in hydrologic fields. Nevertheless, these latest efforts have been limited to temporal coverage (∼30 years) and mostly simplified hydraulic scheme routing in rivers, which can be inadequate for regional and long term scale objectives. In this article, a dataset (called hydrological reanalysis across the 20th century [HRXX] in the Amazon Basin) was developed as a case study spanning back to the year 1900 through the use of: 1) a large-scale hydrologic-hydrodynamic model (MGB) forced by a long-term climatic reanalysis of rainfall (ERA-20CM) with bias removed; and 2) a data assimilation (DA) technique coupled with a localization method (LEnKF) to use several ground observations of daily discharge within a radius of influence. Several tests were assessed to find the best bias removal method, the optimal radius of influence for the localization method and the final HRXX dataset. A total of 114 hydrological ground observations of daily information were used for assimilation and validation purposes, and several statistics indexes were employed to assess their performance. Results indicate that both bias correction and the DA with localization method greatly improved the simulations. Overestimations of the peaks in the open-loop (OL) (free run) simulation, mainly in the southern and northern regions of the Amazon Basin, were removed, and recession timing in the east-central region, as seen at the {\'{O}}bidos gauge station, were corrected. An average performance of ∼0.6 and ∼0.7 of the Nash–Sutcliffe and Kling–Gupta indexes was reached, even when only a few of the longest ground observations were used, which can be representative of the oldest periods (since ∼1930). To assess extreme events, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used for maximum and minimum annual water level anomaly values, reaching 0.6 and 0.7, respectively, at the Manaus gauge station, which is remarkable considering that the analysis covers approximately 110 years. Considering the results of this case study and the global coverage of rainfall datasets, this methodology can be transferred to other regions in order to better estimate and create a hydrological reanalysis that adequately represents the hydrologic and hydraulic spatio-temporal fields.},

abstract = {Although the wet season in the tropical Amazon (10°N-20°S) at any one place and in any one year is initiated rapidly by synoptic systems, large-scale thermodynamic conditions modulate the frequency and intensity of these synoptic systems and hence control the climatology of the wet season. In this study, the satellite radiances, radiosondes, and assimilation data of the atmosphere are analyzed to show that the conditioning of the large-scale thermodynamics for the onset of the wet season is controlled by a moistening of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and a lowering of temperature at its top, hence reducing convective inhibition energy (CINE). These changes occur either in phase with or lagging by one month the enhancement of low-level moisture convergence. Integration of a slab mixed-layer model shows how a higher humidity can reduce the drying effect of the entrainment and increase the humidity of the daytime PBL. Hence, the increase of low-level moisture convergence may provide enough moisture to initiate the wet seasons. In the southern part of the basin (5°S-20°S), the land surface warming from austral winter to spring reduces the strong stability of the dry season and increases the frequency of unstable profiles for deep convection (fCUS), but convection remains infrequent until, in addition, the PBL is moistened and the inversion decays to lower CINE in October. The latter occur one month after the moisture becomes convergent. The seasonal changes in land surface temperatures are stronger than those over the adjacent oceans and hence have more influence on the gradient between land and ocean, and so on the changes in the large-scale circulation. In the equatorial western Amazon, a warmer land surface provides high fCUS all year round, but the seasonal changes of convection are more controlled by CINE. In the eastern basin, a lower fCUS in spring suppresses the expected wet season. Hence, convection is most frequent during austral fall, but also occurs in austral spring in the western Amazon. Higher fCUS and lower CINE are largely contributed to by the increases in humidity and weakening of the inversion. In contrast to the southern part of the basin, changes in local land surface temperature are small so that changes of the surface temperature in the adjacent oceans and southern Amazon largely control the changes in temperature gradient between land and ocean, and hence the seasonal onset of equatorial convection.},

The aim of this paper is to propose a general interface for coupling general circulation models GCMs to land surface {\v{Z}} . schemes LSS in order to achieve a plug compatibility between these complex models. As surface parameterizations include more processes, they have moved from being subroutines of GCMs to independent schemes which can also be applied for other purposes. This evolution has raised the problem within climate modeling groups of coupling these schemes to GCMs in a simple and flexible way. As LSS reaches a larger independence, a general interface is needed to enable exchange within the community. This paper discusses the tasks LSS have to fulfill when coupled to a GCM after a review of the current state of the art and the likely future evolutions of both components. The numerical schemes used for the processes which couple the land surfaces to the atmosphere are reviewed to ensure that the interface can be applied to all LSS and GCMs after only minor changes. q},

Using daily in situ river discharge data along with altimetry-derived river heights, the present study aims to produce a monthly data set of altimetry-derived Ganga-Brahmaputra River discharge at the river mouths for 1993&8211;2008. First, we estimate the standard error of ENVISAT-derived water levels over the Ganga to be 0.26 m, much smaller than the range of variability of &8764;7 m, and consistent with the accuracy of altimeter measurements over large rivers. We then establish rating curves between altimetry-derived water levels and in situ river discharges and show that TOPEX-Poseidon, ERS-2, and ENVISAT data can successfully be used to infer Ganga and Brahmaputra discharge. The mean error on the estimated daily discharge derived from altimetry ranges from &8764;15% (&8764;4700 m3/s) using TOPEX-Poseidon over the Brahmaputra to &8764;36% (&8764;9000 m3/s) using ERS-2 over the Ganga. Combined Ganga-Brahmaputra monthly discharges for 1993&8211;2008 are presented, showing a mean error of &8764;17% (&8764;2700 m3/s), within the range (15%&8211;20%) of acceptable accuracy for discharge measurements. During 2004&8211;2008, we assess the variability of the estimate against precipitation and river heights records. Finally, we present a basic approach to infer Ganga-Brahmaputra monthly discharge at the river mouths. The upscaled discharge exhibits a marked interannual variability with a standard deviation in excess of &8764;12,500 m3/s, much larger than the data set uncertainty. This new data set represents an unprecedented source of information to quantify continental freshwater forcing flux into Indian Ocean circulation models.},

The Andes runs through seven countries and is characterized by a wide variety of ecosystems strongly related to the contrasting climate over its eastern and western sides, as well as along its latitudinal extension. This region faces very high potential impacts of climate change, which could affect food and water security for about 90 million people. In addition, climate change represents an important threat on biodiversity, particularly in the tropical Andes, which is the most biodiverse region on Earth. From a scientific and societal view, the Andes exhibits specific challenges because of its unique landscape and the fragile equilibrium between the growing population and its environment. In this manuscript, we provide an updated review of the most relevant scientific literature regarding the hydroclimate of the Andes with an integrated view of the entire Andes range. This review paper is presented in two parts. Part I is dedicated to summarize the scientific knowledge about the main climatic features of the Andes, with emphasis on mean large-scale atmospheric circulation, the Andes-Amazon hydroclimate interconnections and the most distinctive diurnal and annual cycles of precipitation. Part II, which is also included in the research topic “Connecting Mountain Hydroclimate Through the American Cordilleras,” focuses on the hydroclimate variability of the Andes at the sub-continental scale, including the effects of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation.},

abstract = {This letter uses satellite remote sensing to examine patterns of cropland expansion, cropland abandonment, and changing cropping frequency in Mato Grosso, Brazil from 2001 to 2011. During this period, Mato Grosso emerged as a globally important center of agricultural production. In 2001, 3.3 million hectares of mechanized agriculture were cultivated in Mato Grosso, of which 500 000 hectares had two commercial crops per growing season (double cropping). By 2011, Mato Grosso had 5.8 million hectares of mechanized agriculture, of which 2.9 million hectares were double cropped. We found these agricultural changes to be selective with respect to land attributes - significant differences (p<0.001) existed between the land attributes of agriculture Versus non-agriculture, single cropping Versus double cropping, and expansion Versus abandonment. Many of the land attributes (elevation, slope, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, initial soy transport costs, and soil) that were associated with an increased likelihood of expansion were associated with a decreased likelihood of abandonment (p<0.001). While land similar to agriculture and double cropping in 2001 was much more likely to be developed for agriculture than all other land, new cropland shifted to hotter, drier, lower locations that were more isolated from agricultural infrastructure (p<0.001). The scarcity of high quality remaining agricultural land available for agricultural expansion in Mato Grosso could be contributing to the slowdown in agricultural expansion observed there over 2006 to 2011. Land use policy analyses should control for land scarcity constraints on agricultural expansion. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {AbstractA new retrospective satellite-based precipitation dataset is constructed as a climate data record for hydrological and climate studies. Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks–Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) provides daily and 0.25° rainfall estimates for the latitude band 60°S–60°N for the period of 1 January 1983 to 31 December 2012 (delayed present). PERSIANN-CDR is aimed at addressing the need for a consistent, long-term, high-resolution, and global precipitation dataset for studying the changes and trends in daily precipitation, especially extreme precipitation events, due to climate change and natural variability. PERSIANN-CDR is generated from the PERSIANN algorithm using GridSat-B1 infrared data. It is adjusted using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly product to maintain consistency of the two datasets at 2.5° monthly scale throughout the entire record. Three case studies for testing the efficacy of the dataset ...},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature. The water cycle components are being retrieved by an increasing number of satellite missions. However, the monitoring of the water cycle by satellite Earth Observations is still a challenge. Data sets suffer from numerous systematic and random errors and they are often not coherent with each other. We focus here on the Mediterranean basin, one of the regions most sensitive to climate change. A satellite-based analysis of the water cycle is undertaken using a collection of available satellite data sets. Our satellite data set combination uses a simple bias correction and weighted average, and provides a better water budget closure results than any raw satellite data set. Our almost purely satellite data set allows to better describe the full water cycle, not only over the continents, but also in the atmosphere and over the ocean. The limitation/possibilities of this satellite multi-component data set are described: (1) although improved, the water cycle is still not closed by satellite data and the satellite community should focus on this issue, (2) our combined data set shows good coherency with the ERA-I reanalysis which is the reference so far, both in terms of seasonal climatology and long-term trends. This means that, even if the water budget is not yet closed by satellite data, our monitoring of the water cycle using satellite observations is improving, even over complex regions such as the Mediterranean basin.},

abstract = {High-resolution, long-term and accurate daily-precipitation is always difficult and rarely measured in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) because of the high altitude and complex terrain. The accuracy of satellite-based gridded precipitation products have been continuously improved recently which is crucial to the study of cryosphere ecology and environment. The goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of CHIRPS v2 (Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations data, version 2) and MSWEP v2 (Multi-source weighted-Ensemble Precipitation, version 2) daily-precipitation products over the QTP during the period 1981–2015. Validation was done using a time series of daily-precipitation data obtained from 104 hydrometeorological stations distributed over the QTP. Error metrics (The correlation coefficient CC, the relative bias BIAS, and root mean square error RMSE) were used for accuracy evaluation and detectability indicators (probability of detection POD, false alarm ratio RFA, and critical success index CSI) were used for the analysis of detection capabilities of rainfall occurrence events. The results indicate that when compared to rain gauge observations, CHIRPS and MSWEP daily-precipitation products represent well the spatial and temporal distribution of the mean daily precipitation over the QTP, while both of them overestimate the daily-precipitation (0.18 mm/d for CHIRPS, 0.56 mm/d for MSWEP). MSWEP performed better than CHIRPS according to CC (MSWEP is 0.44, CHIRPS is 0.23) and RMSE (MSWEP is 4.21 mm, CHIRPS is 5.03 mm) and MSWEP showed better detection capabilities with higher POD (0.65), lower RFA (0.50) and higher CSI (0.39) in the QTP. Both products are less accurate in dry conditions (the north QTP, winter) than in moist conditions (the south QTP, summer). Light precipitation events (0–2 mm/d) are underestimated but heavy precipitation events (2–25 mm/d) are overestimated. CHIRPS and MSWEP have shown great potential to be able to be applied to the precipitation-related study of the QTP. Although the accuracy of MSWEP is higher than that of CHIRPS, the latter has higher spatial resolution (o.o5°) and is more suitable for small-scale studies.},

The water level network has long been plagued by difficulties associated with spatial coverage, timely delivery and data errors. Satellite observations are important means for providing hydrologic data with acceptable spatial and temporal resolution, and radar altimeters embarked onboard successive satellites since the early 1970s collect measurements of water level over rivers in a well-defined geodetic reference frame and can be used to address some of these problems. Nowadays, satellite altimetry can be used to collect the time variations of the water levels over many rivers throughout the word, as long as the reach are several hundred meters wide. This ability is particularly interesting in ungauge basins but it can also be used as an independent source of information to cross-check existing gauge series.

abstract = {Increased energy demand has led to plans for building many new dams in the western Amazon, mostly in the Andean region. Historical data and mechanistic scenarios are used to examine potential impacts above and below six of the largest dams planned for the region, including reductions in downstream sediment and nutrient supplies, changes in downstream flood pulse, changes in upstream and downstream fish yields, reservoir siltation, greenhouse gas emissions and mercury contamination. Together, these six dams are predicted to reduce the supply of sediments, phosphorus and nitrogen from the Andean region by 69, 67 and 57% and to the entire Amazon basin by 64, 51 and 23%, respectively. These large reductions in sediment and nutrient supplies will have major impacts on channel geomorphology, floodplain fertility and aquatic productivity. These effects will be greatest near the dams and extend to the lowland floodplains. Attenuation of the downstream flood pulse is expected to alter the survival, phenology and growth of floodplain vegetation and reduce fish yields below the dams. Reservoir filling times due to siltation are predicted to vary from 106–6240 years, affecting the storage performance of some dams. Total CO2 equivalent carbon emission from 4 Andean dams was expected to average 10 Tg y-1 during the first 30 years of operation, resulting in a MegaWatt weighted Carbon Emission Factor of 0.139 tons C MWhr-1. Mercury contamination in fish and local human populations is expected to increase both above and below the dams creating significant health risks. Reservoir fish yields will compensate some downstream losses, but increased mercury contamination could offset these benefits.},

Thus, overall the monthly temperature climate has not become more extreme. Midtwentieth century including the 1930s was an earlier period of frequent very warm months, a result of very warm daytime temperatures, while nighttime temperatures were not unusual. Regionally, there is a lack of century-scale warming in the southeast U.S. annually and in parts of the central U.S. in the summer, characterized by lack of daytime warming while there has been nighttime warming.

abstract = {ITSG-Grace2018 is a new series of GRACE-only gravity field solutions based on reprocessed GRACE observation data (L1B RL03) and the latest atmosphere and ocean dealiasing product (AOD1B RL06). It includes unconstrained monthly and constrained daily solutions, as well as a high-resolution static gravity field. Compared to the previous ITSG release, we implemented a number of improvements within the processing chain and use updated background models. In an effort to better model all known error sources, we propagate synthetic orientation uncertainties of the star camera assembly to the antenna offset correction for intersatellite ranging observations. This enables the disentanglement of the stationary noise of the K-Band system and the nonstationary noise of the antenna offset correction. We further incorporated uncertainties of the atmosphere and ocean dealiasing product to reduce temporal aliasing effects. To mitigate errors in the applied ocean tide model, we used constrained GRACE estimates of selected tidal constituents as an additional background model. Variability over quiet ocean areas suggests a 27% to 46% lower noise level compared to the current spherical harmonic solutions of the official processing centers (300 km Gaussian filter applied). To ensure that the low noise floor is not accompanied by signal loss, we examined drainage basin averages, which showed consistent amplitudes with the official GRACE time series. These evaluations lead to the conclusion that ITSG-Grace2018 is a state-of-the-art GRACE time series which exhibits an excellent signal-to-noise ratio.},

abstract = {The quantification of precipitation on a global scale is critical for applications ranging from climate monitoring to water resource management. Conventional observations through surface gauge networks provide the most direct measure of precipitation, although these are very much limited to land areas, with very few in situ measurements over the oceans. Weather radars, although providing a spatial measure of precipitation, are limited in extent and number. Satellite observations offer an unrivalled vantage point to observe precipitation on a global basis. Since precipitation is spatially and temporally highly variable, satellites are able to provide temporal and spatial samples commensurate with many precipitation characteristics. This paper provides an overall review of global precipitation estimation, providing an outline of conventional measurements, the basis of the satellite systems used in the observation of precipitation, and the generation, availability and validation of the derived precipitation products. Finally, future satellite precipitation missions are presented. {\textcopyright}2011 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Roughness height for heat transfer is a crucial parameter in estimation of heat transfer between the land surface and the atmosphere. Although many empirical formulations have been proposed over the past few decades, the uncertainties associated with these formulations are shown to be large, especially over sparse canopies. In this contribution, a simple physically based model is derived for the estimation of the roughness height for heat transfer. This model is derived from a complex physical model based on the "localized near-field" Lagrangian theory. This model (called Massman's model) and another recently proposed model derived by fitting simulation results of a simple multisource bulk transfer model (termed Bl{\"{u}}mel's model) are evaluated using three experimental datasets. The results of the model performances are judged by using the derived roughness values to compute sensible heat fluxes with the bulk transfer formulation and comparing these computed fluxes to the observed sensible heat fluxes. It is concluded, on the basis of comparison of calculated versus observed sensible heat fluxes, that both the current model and Bl{\"{u}}mel's model provide reliable estimates of the roughness heights for heat transfer. The current model is further shown to be able to explain the diurnal variation in the roughness height for heat transfer. On the basis of a sensitivity analysis, it is suggested that, although demanding, most of the information needed for both models is amendable by satellite remote sensing such that their global incorporation into large-scale atmospheric models for both numerical weather prediction and climate research merits further investigation.},

abstract = {The location of eight rainfall stations in the Zongo valley (Eastern Cordillera-Bolivia) between 1195 and 4750 meters above sea level (masl) gives a unique opportunity to study the time-space rainfall variability between two regions, i.e. the Altiplano and the Amazonian lowlands of Bolivia, that are differently related to El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the Pacific. In the central part of the lowlands, a La Ni{\~{n}}a/dry signal is observed during the peak of the rainy season (February) and around wintertime (May and September). Going toward the Andes and on the foothills up to 1500 masl, no ENSO signal has been found. On the median slopes of the Zongo valley, between 1800 and 3500 m, a strong Ni{\~{n}}o/dry signal is depicted on an annual timescale and during summer. In February, a Ni{\~{n}}a/wet signal is also significant. Going westward through the high Andes and the eastern Altiplano, this signal weakens. On the western edge of the Altiplano, an El Ni{\~{n}}o/dry and La Ni{\~{n}}a/wet signals are clearly identified. In the central lowlands and on the western Altiplano, ENSO indexes account for nearly 25% of rainfall variability, and for as much as 50% along the median slopes of the eastern Cordillera, in the Zongo valley. This finding deserves further study as previous researches have shown that in the Andes the best relationship between rainfall and equatorial Pacific sea-surface temperature (SST) is in the westem Altiplano, far from the Amazonian source of moisture.

abstract = {In the Amazon basin, the recently released SRTM Global 1 arc-second (SRTMGL1) remains the best topographic information for hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling purposes. However, its accuracy is hindered by errors, partly due to vegetation, leading to erroneous simulations. Previous efforts to remove the vegetation signal either did not account for its spatial variability or relied on a single assumed percentage of penetration of the SRTM signal. Here, we propose a systematic approach over an Amazonian floodplain to remove the vegetation signal, addressing its heterogeneity by combining estimates of vegetation height and a land cover map. We improve this approach by interpolating the first results with drainage network, field and altimetry data to obtain a hydrological conditioned DEM. The averaged interferometric and vegetation biases over the forest zone were found to b{\'{e}}2.0 m and 7.4 m, respectively. Comparing the original and corrected DEM, vertical validation against Ground Control Points shows a RMSE reduction of 64%. Flood extent accuracy, controlled against Landsat and JERS-1 images, stresses improvements in low and high water periods (+24% and +18%, respectively). This study also highlights that a ground truth drainage network, as a unique input during the interpolation, achieves reasonable results in terms of flood extent and hydrological characteristics.},

abstract = {Spatial water resource monitoring systems (SWRMS) can provide valuable information in support of water management, but current operational systems are few and provide only a subset of the information required. Necessary innovations include the explicit description of water redistribution and water use from river and groundwater systems, achieving greater spatial detail (particularly in key features such as irrigated areas and wetlands), and improving accuracy as assessed against hydrometric observations, as well as assimilating those observations. The Australian water resources assessment (AWRA) system aims to achieve this by coupling landscape models with models describing surface water and groundwater dynamics and water use. A review of operational and research applications demonstrates that satellite observations can improve accuracy and spatial detail in hydrological model estimation. All operational systems use dynamic forcing, land cover classifications and a priori parameterisation of vegetation dynamics that are partially or wholly derived from remote sensing. Satellite observations are used to varying degrees in model evaluation and data assimilation. The utility of satellite observations through data assimilation can vary as a function of dominant hydrological processes. Opportunities for improvement are identified, including the development of more accurate and higher spatial and temporal resolution precipitation products, and the use of a greater range of remote sensing products in a priori model parameter estimation, model evaluation and data assimilation. Operational challenges include the continuity of research satellite missions and data services, and the need to find computationally-efficient data assimilation techniques. The successful use of observations critically depends on the availability of detailed information on observational error and understanding of the relationship between remotely-sensed and model variables, as affected by conceptual discrepancies and spatial and temporal scaling.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates the potential for applying passive microwave satellite sensor data to infer the discharge dynamics of large river systems using the main stem Amazon as a test case. The methodology combines (1) interpolated ground-based meteorological station data, (2) horizontally and vertically polarized temperature differences (HVPTD) from the 37-GHz scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite, and (3) a calibrated water balance/water transport model (WBM/WTM). Monthly HVPTD values at 0.25° (latitude by longitude) resolution were resampled spatially and temporally to produce an enhanced HVPTD time series at 0.5° resolution for the period May 1979 through February 1985. Enhanced HVPTD values were regressed against monthly discharge derived from the WBM/WTM for each of 40 grid cells along the main stem over a calibration period from May 1979 to February 1983 to provide a spatially contiguous estimate of time-varying discharge. HVPTD-estimated flows generated for a validation period from March 1983 to February 1985 were found to be in good agreement with both observed and modeled discharges over a 1400-km section of the main stem Amazon. This span of river is bounded downstream by a region of tidal influence and upstream by low sensor response associated with dense forest canopy. Both the WBM/WTM and HVPTD-derived flow rates reflect the significant impact of the 19821983 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event on water balances within the drainage basin.},

abstract = {High-resolution raster hydrography maps are a fundamental data source for many geoscience applications. Here we introduce MERIT Hydro, a new global flow direction map at 3-arc sec resolution ($\sim$90 m at the equator) derived from the latest elevation data (MERIT DEM) and water body data sets (G1WBM, Global Surface Water Occurrence, and OpenStreetMap). We developed a new algorithm to extract river networks near automatically by separating actual inland basins from dummy depressions caused by the errors in input elevation data. After a minimum amount of hand editing, the constructed hydrography map shows good agreement with existing quality-controlled river network data sets in terms of flow accumulation area and river basin shape. The location of river streamlines was realistically aligned with existing satellite-based global river channel data. Relative error in the drainage area was <0.05 for 90% of Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) gauges, confirming the accuracy of the delineated global river networks. Discrepancies in flow accumulation area were found mostly in arid river basins containing depressions that are occasionally connected at high water levels and thus resulting in uncertain watershed boundaries. MERIT Hydro improves on existing global hydrography data sets in terms of spatial coverage (between N90 and S60) and representation of small streams, mainly due to increased availability of high-quality baseline geospatial data sets. The new flow direction and flow accumulation maps, along with accompanying supplementary layers on hydrologically adjusted elevation and channel width, will advance geoscience studies related to river hydrology at both global and local scales.},

abstract = {Global estimates of river dynamics are needed in order to manage water resources, mainly in developing countries where in-situ observation is limited. Remote sensors such as nadir altimeters can complement ground data. Current altimeters miss however a large number of continental surface water bodies. This issue will be largely resolved by the future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, thanks to its wide swath altimeter. SWOT will provide almost globally two-dimensional water elevation maps for rivers over 100 m wide and water bodies over 250 m × 250 m. During this research, we investigated the potential of SWOT to correct hydrological models on a global/continental scale, through data assimilation. For this purpose, an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE), also known as “twin experiment”, has been implemented. Model forcings and parameters were perturbed to jointly achieve global hydrological models (GHMs) uncertainties, which is the expected scenario in which the SWOT community will mainly evaluate the future SWOT data. SWOT-like observations of water surface elevation (WSE), flooded water extent (FWE), and/or SWOT derived discharge (Q) were used to correct modelled Q, WSE and FWE from a large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic model (MGB – portuguese acronym of “Modelo de Grandes Bacias”), using a Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The results indicate that SWOT products could largely improve hydrological simulations on a global and continental scale. SWOT-like discharge can reduce $\sim$40% of model errors in daily discharge. Furthermore, when anomalies of the WSE DA approach were implemented, the error reduction was even greater for all state variables compared to the absolute WSE DA, achieving average error reduction values of about $\sim$30% compared to $\sim$24%. Finally, the simultaneous DA of all the SWOT-like variables together reduces errors from $\sim$14% to $\sim$22% compared to the average of assimilating only one variable.},

abstract = {Traditional Neural Networks (NN) have been popular in the satellite remote sensing community for the last 25 years. For coarse resolution infrared or microwave instruments, NN algorithms have been used at the pixel level. New neural architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) use the Deep Learning (DL) approach to solve complex problems at the image scale. For instance, CNNs have been applied to high resolution instruments (SAR or in the visible domain) to detect surface waters or vegetation. High resolution data is better suited for image processing techniques because spatial features are stronger and pixel noise can be an important issue. CNNs applications are generally related to image classification or segmentation, less for regression problems dealing with the estimation of a variable in each pixel of the image. The objective of this paper is to better understand how and on which conditions CNNs work, and how beneficial they can be for coarse resolution instruments such as IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer). The CNN and DL approaches are tested in a regression mode, to estimate the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) at the image scale. The CNN technique is compared to a traditional pixel-based NN: both have a SST retrieval error of 0.3 K. An instrument noise and a missing data sensitivity studies are conducted. It is shown that the use of the CNN approach in this simple-experiment context is beneficial only under some conditions: when the variable to retrieve has enough spatial coherency (simple smoothness or presence of spatial features in the images), and when the instrument noise at the pixel scale is larger than a threshold. This study is a preliminary illustration of what can be expected from CNNs for coarse resolution instruments such as IASI.},

abstract = {What hydraulic information can be gained from remotely sensed observations of a river's surface? In this study, we analyze the relationship between river bed undulations and water surfaces for an ungauged reach of the Xingu River, a first-order tributary of the Amazon river. This braided reach is crosscut more than 10 times by a ENVISAT (ENVironmental SATellite) track that extends over 100 km. Rating curves based on a modeled discharge series and altimetric measurements are used, including the zero-flow depth Z0 parameter, which describes river's bathymetry. River widths are determined from JERS (Japanese Earth Ressources Satellite) images. Hydrodynamic laws predict that irregularities in the geometry of a river bed produce spatial and temporal variations in the water level, as well as in its slope. Observation of these changes is a goal of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission, which has a final objective of determining river discharge. First, the concept of hydraulic visibility is introduced, and the seasonality of water surface slope is highlighted along with different flow regimes and reach behaviors. Then, we propose a new single-thread effective hydraulic approach for modeling braided rivers flows, based on the observation scales of current satellite altimetry. The effective hydraulic model is able to reproduce water surface elevations derived by satellite altimetry, and it shows that hydrodynamical signatures are more visible in areas where the river bed morphology varies significantly and for reaches with strong downstream control. The results of this study suggest that longitudinal variations of the slope might be an interesting criteria for the analysis of river segmentation into elementary reaches for the Surface Water Ocean Topography mission that will provide continuous measurements of the water surface elevations, the slopes, and the reach widths.},

abstract = {In this study, a satellite-derived precipitation "climatology" (climate description) over northern South America using a passive microwave technique, the Goddard Profiling algorithm, is presented. The results are statistically adjusted to have the same probability distribution as a rain gauge dataset. The climatologies take the form of the mean estimated rainfall for a 10-yr+ period, with subdivisions by month and meteorological season. For the 6-yr period 1992-97, when two satellites were in operation, diurnal variability (to the extent it is discerned by four unequally spaced observations) is presented. In the mean, dramatic patterns of alternating morning and evening maxima are seen stretching from the northeast (Atlantic coast) across the continent to the Pacific. The effects of local circulations caused by topography, coastlines, and geography (river valleys) on the rainfall patterns are evident, particularly in the region around Manaus, Brazil, where the Negro and Solimoes Rivers merge. The interannual variability of the 10-yr rainfall estimate is examined by computing the deviations of yearly and warm-season (December-February) rainfall from their respective long-term means. Rainfall anomalies associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events then become apparent. This gauge-adjusted satellite climatology enhances existing (gauge based) climatologies by increasing the spatial resolution and providing a common, spaceborne platform for assessing interannual variability. It maintains the same first- and second-order statistics as does the gauge dataset, and allows a first attempt at examining the diurnal cycles by utilizing passive microwave observations (up to) four times per day.},

Several studies have already been conducted to analyze the Thai floods, but none of themhave assessed the impacts of reservoir operation on flood inundation. This study addresses this gap by combining physically based hydrologicalmodels to explicitly simulate the impacts of reservoir operation on flooding in the Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand. H08, an integrated water resources model with a reservoir operationmodule, was combined with CaMa-Flood, a river routingmodel with representation of flood dynamics. The combined H08-CaMa model was applied to simulate and assess the historical and alternative reservoir operation rules in the two largest reservoirs in the basin. The combined H08-CaMamodel effectively simulated the 2011 flood: regulated flows at a major gauging station have high daily NSE-coefficient of 92% as compared with observed discharge; spatiotemporal extent of simulated flood inundationmatch well with those of satellite observa- tions. Simulation results show that through the operation of reservoirs in 2011, flood volume was reduced by 8.6 billionm3 and both depth and area of flooding were reduced by 40% on the average. Nonetheless, simple modifications in reservoir operation proved to further reduce the flood volume by 2.4millionm3 and the depth and area of flooding by 20% on the average. Bymodeling reservoir operation with a hydrodynamic model, amore realistic simulation of the 2011 Thai flood was made possible, and the potential of reducing flood inundation through improved reservoir management was quantified},

abstract = {Satellites are an alternative source of rainfall data used as input to hydrological models in poorly gauged or ungauged regions. They are also useful in regions with highly heterogeneous precipitation, such as the tropical Andes. This paper evaluates three satellite precipitation datasets (TMPA, CMORPH, PERSIANN), as well as a dataset based only on rain gauge data (HYBAM), and their impacts on the water balance of the Western Amazon basin, a region where hydrological modeling and hydrological forecasting are poorly developed. These datasets were used as inputs in the MGB-IPH hydrological model to simulate streamflows for the 2003-2009 period. The impacts of precipitation on model parameterization and outputs were evaluated in two calibration experiments. In Experiment 1, parameter sets were separately defined for each catchment; in Experiment 2, a single parameter set was defined for the entire basin. TMPA shows overestimated precipitation over the northern region, while CMORPH and PERSIANN significantly underestimate rainfall in the same that region and along the Andes. TMPA and CMORPH lead to similar estimates of mean evapotranspiration ($\sim$2. mm/day) for different regions along the entire basin, while PERSIANN is the least accurate ($\sim$0.5. mm/day). Overall, better scores for streamflow simulations are obtained with Experiment 1 forced by HYBAM and TMPA. Nevertheless, results using the three satellite datasets indicate inter-basin differences, low performance in the northern and high in the southern regions. Low model performances are mainly related to scale issues and forcing errors in small basins over regions that present very low rainfall seasonality.},

abstract = {<p>Abstract. In the Amazon Basin, floodplain inundation is a key component of surface water dynamics and plays an important role in water, energy and carbon cycles. The Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART) was extended with a macroscale inundation scheme for representing floodplain inundation. The extended model, named MOSART-Inundation, was used to simulate surface hydrology of the entire Amazon Basin. Previous hydrologic modeling studies in the Amazon Basin identified and addressed a few challenges in simulating surface hydrology of this basin, including uncertainties of floodplain topography and channel geometry, and the representation of river flow in reaches with mild slopes. This study further addressed four aspects of these challenges. First, the spatial variability of vegetation-caused biases embedded in the HydroSHEDS digital elevation model (DEM) data was explicitly addressed. A vegetation height map of about 1 km resolution and a land cover dataset of about 90 m resolution were used in a DEM correction procedure that resulted in an average elevation reduction of 13.2 m for the entire basin and led to evident changes in the floodplain topography. Second, basin-wide empirical formulae for channel cross-sectional dimensions were refined for various subregions to improve the representation of spatial variability in channel geometry. Third, the channel Manning roughness coefficient was allowed to vary with the channel depth, as the effect of riverbed resistance on river flow generally declines with increasing river size. Lastly, backwater effects were accounted for to better represent river flow in mild-slope reaches. The model was evaluated against in situ streamflow records and remotely sensed Envisat altimetry data and Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) inundation data. In a sensitivity study, seven simulations were compared to evaluate the impacts of the five modeling aspects addressed in this study. The comparisons showed that representing floodplain inundation could significantly improve the simulated streamflow and river stages. Refining floodplain topography, channel geometry and Manning roughness coefficients, as well as accounting for backwater effects had notable impacts on the simulated surface water dynamics in the Amazon Basin. The understanding obtained in this study could be helpful in improving modeling of surface hydrology in basins with evident inundation, especially at regional to continental scales.</p>},

abstract = {We investigated the seasonal patterns of water vapor and sensible heat flux along a tropical biome gradient from forest to savanna. We analyzed data from a network of flux towers in Brazil that were operated within the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). These tower sites included tropical humid and semideciduous forest, transitional forest, floodplain (with physiognomies of cerrado), and cerrado sensu stricto. The mean annual sensible heat flux at all sites ranged from 20 to 38 Wm-2, and was generally reduced in the wet season and increased in the late dry season, coincident with seasonal variations of net radiation and soil moisture. The sites were easily divisible into two functional groups based on the seasonality of evaporation: tropical forest and savanna. At sites with an annual precipitation above 1900 mm and a dry season length less than 4 months (Manaus, Santar{\'{e}}m and Rondonia), evaporation rates increased in the dry season, coincident with increased radiation. Evaporation rates were as high as 4.0 mm d-1 in these evergreen or semidecidous forests. In contrast, ecosystems with precipitation less than 1700 mm and a longer dry season (Mato Grosso, Tocantins and S{\~{a}}o Paulo) showed clear evidence of reduced evaporation in the dry season. Evaporation rates were as low as 2.5 mm d-1 in the transitional forests and 1 mm d-1 in the cerrado. The controls on evapotranspiration seasonality changed along the biome gradient, with evaporative demand (especially net radiation) playing a more important role in the wetter forests, and soil moisture playing a more important role in the drier savannah sites.

These air–sea exchange processes are critical for understanding and predicting atmosphere, ocean, and wave phenomena on many time and space scales. A cross-calibrated multiplatform (CCMP) long-term data record of satellite ocean surface winds is available from 1987 to 2008 with planned extensions through 2012. A variational analysis method (VAM) is used to combine surface wind data derived from conventional and in situ sources and multiple satellites into a consistent nearglobal analysis at 25-km resolution, every 6 h.

abstract = {AbstractThe Goddard profiling algorithm has evolved from a pseudoparametric algorithm used in the current TRMM operational product (GPROF 2010) to a fully parametric approach used operationally in the GPM era (GPROF 2014). The fully parametric approach uses a Bayesian inversion for all surface types. The algorithm thus abandons rainfall screening procedures and instead uses the full brightness temperature vector to obtain the most likely precipitation state. This paper offers a complete description of the GPROF 2010 and GPROF 2014 algorithms and assesses the sensitivity of the algorithm to assumptions related to channel uncertainty as well as ancillary data. Uncertainties in precipitation are generally less than 1%–2% for realistic assumptions in channel uncertainties. Consistency among different radiometers is extremely good over oceans. Consistency over land is also good if the diurnal cycle is accounted for by sampling GMI product only at the time of day that different sensors operate. While accounting...},

abstract = {Nine satellite rainfall estimations (SREs) were evaluated for the first time over the South American Andean plateau watershed by comparison with rain gauge data acquired between 2005 and 2007. The comparisons were carried out at the annual, monthly and daily time steps. All SREs reproduce the salient pattern of the annual rain field, with a marked north–south gradient and a lighter east–west gradient. However, the intensity of the gradient differs among SREs: it is well marked in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42 (TMPA-3B42), Precipitation Estimation from remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) products, and it is smoothed out in the Climate prediction center MORPHing (CMORPH) products. Another interesting difference among products is the contrast in rainfall amounts between the water surfaces (Lake Titicaca) and the surrounding land. Some products (TMPA-3B42, PERSIANN and GSMaP) show a contradictory rainfall deficit over Lake Titicaca, which may be due to the emissivity contrast between the lake and the surrounding lands and warm rain cloud processes. An analysis differentiating coastal Lake Titicaca from inland pixels confirmed this trend. The raw or Real Time (RT) products have strong biases over the study region. These biases are strongly positive for PERSIANN (above 90%), moderately positive for TMPA-3B42 (28%), strongly negative for CMORPH (− 42%) and moderately negative for GSMaP (− 18%). The biases are associated with a deformation of the rain rate frequency distribution: GSMaP underestimates the proportion of rainfall events for all rain rates; CMORPH overestimates the proportion of rain rates below 2 mm day − 1 ; and the other products tend to overestimate the proportion of moderate to high rain rates. These biases are greatly reduced by the gauge adjustment in the TMPA-3B42, PERSIANN and CMORPH products, whereas a negative bias becomes positive for GSMaP. TMPA-3B42 Adjusted (Adj) version 7 demonstrates the best overall agreement with gauges in terms of correlation, rain rate distribution and bias. However, PERSIANN-Adj's bias in the southern part of the domain is very low.},

abstract = {Motivated by the question of whether recent interannual to decadal climate variability and a possible "climate shift"may have affected the global water balance, we examine precipitation minus evaporation (P - E) variability integrated over the global oceans and global land for the period 1979-2010 from three points of view-remotely sensed retrievals and syntheses over the oceans, reanalysis vertically integrated moisture flux convergence (VMFC) over land, and land surface models (LSMs) forced with observations-based precipitation, radiation, and near-surface meteorology. Over land, reanalysis VMFC and P 2evapotranspiration (ET) from observationally forced LSMs agree on interannual variations (e.g., El Ni{\~{n}}o/La Ni{\~{n}}a events); however, reanalyses exhibit upward VMFC trends 3-4 times larger than P - ET trends of the LSMs. Experiments with other reanalyses using reduced observations show that upward VMFC trends in the full reanalyses are due largely to observing system changes interacting with assimilation model physics. The much smaller P - ET trend in the LSMs appears due to changes in frequency and amplitude of warm events after the 1997/98 El Ni{\~{n}}o, a result consistent with coolness in the eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) after that date. When integrated over the global oceans, E and especially P variations show consistent signals of El Ni{\~{n}}o/La Ni{\~{n}}a events. However, at scales longer than interannual there is considerable uncertainty especially in E. This results from differences among datasets in near-surface atmospheric specific humidity and wind speed used in bulk aerodynamic retrievals. The P variations, all relying substantially on passive microwave retrievals over ocean, also have uncertainties in decadal variability, but to a smaller degree. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

Using numerical metrics in order to evaluate performance, monthly rainfall estimates, from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation and Stations (CHIRPS v.2) product, are compared to gauge data from the 1981-2007 interval and categorical metrics for assessing rain-detection skills. The analysis was performed considering different rainfall categories, seasonality, and spatial context. The results show that the satellite product CHIRPS v.2 overestimates (underestimates) low (high) monthly rainfall values; although on the majority of numerical metrics of skill shows a good performance. This product, on the other hand, achieves better performance during the rainy season (April-September), significantly overestimating, however, the rainfall-events frequency. The product also shows best overall performance over flat and open regions (e.g., Los Llanos), where precipitation is influenced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone activity and local convective systems.},

abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is now recognized as an important pathway between land and sea. As such, this flow may contribute to the biogeochemical and other marine budgets of near-shore waters. These discharges typically display significant spatial and temporal variability making assessments difficult. Groundwater seepage is patchy, diffuse, temporally variable, and may involve multiple aquifers. Thus, the measurement of its magnitude and associated chemical fluxes is a challenging enterprise. A joint project of UNESCO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has examined several methods of SGD assessment and carried out a series of five intercomparison experiments in different hydrogeologic environments (coastal plain, karst, glacial till, fractured crystalline rock, and volcanic terrains). This report reviews the scientific and management significance of SGD, measurement approaches, and the results of the intercomparison experiments. We conclude that while the process is essentially ubiquitous in coastal areas, the assessment of its magnitude at any one location is subject to enough variability that measurements should be made by a variety of techniques and over large enough spatial and temporal scales to capture the majority of these changing conditions. We feel that all the measurement techniques described here are valid although they each have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is recommended that multiple approaches be applied whenever possible. In addition, a continuing effort is required in order to capture long-period tidal fluctuations, storm effects, and seasonal variations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Land models are increasingly used and preferred in terrestrial hydrological prediction applications. One reason for selecting land models over simpler models is that their physically based backbone enables wider application under different conditions. This study evaluates the temporal variability in streamflow simulations in land models. Specifically, we evaluate how the subsurface structure and model parameters control the partitioning of water into different flow paths and the temporal variability in streamflow. Moreover, we use a suite of model diagnostics, typically not used in the land modeling community to clarify model weaknesses and identify a path toward model improvement. Our analyses show that the typical land model structure, and their functions for moisture movement between soil layers (an approximation of Richards equation), has a distinctive signature where flashy runoff is superimposed on slow recessions. This hampers the application of land models in simulating flashier basins and headwater catchments where floods are generated. We demonstrate the added value of the preferential flow in the model simulation by including macropores in both a toy model and the Variable Infiltration Capacity model. We argue that including preferential flow in land models is essential to enable their use for multiple applications across a myriad of temporal and spatial scales.},

abstract = {This study addresses the quantification of the Amazon River sediment budget which has been assessed by looking at data from a suspended sediment discharge monitoring network and remote sensing estimates derived from MODIS spaceborne sensor. Surface suspended sediment concentration has been sampled every 10 days since 1995 (390 samples available) by the international HYBAM program at the {\'{O}}bidos station which happens to be the last gauged station of the Amazon River before the Atlantic Ocean. Remote sensing reflectance is derived from continuous time series of 554 MODIS images available since 2000 and calibrated with the HYBAM field measurements. Discharge shows a weak correlation with the suspended sediment concentration during the annual hydrological cycle, preventing us from computing sediment discharge directly from the water discharge. Accordingly, river sediment discharge is assessed by multiplying daily water discharge measurements by the suspended sediment concentration averaged on a monthly basis. Comparisons of annual sediment discharge assessed using both field and satellite datasets show a very good agreement with a mean difference lower than 1%. Both field and satellite-derived estimates of the sediment concentration of the Amazon River are combined to get an uninterrupted monthly average suspended sediment discharge from 1995 to 2007. Unlike the water discharge which exhibits a steady trend over the same period at {\'{O}}bidos, the 12-year suspended sediment discharge increases by about 20% since 1995, significant at the 99% level. In particular, the inter-annual variability is much more significant in the sediment discharge than in the river discharge. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Trenberth2011,
abstract = {There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: it never rains but it pours! This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid- to high latitudes: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. more bang for the buck, atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Ni o a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.},

abstract = {[1] The Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) is a Fourier Transform Michelson interferometer instrument launched on board the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite on 28 October 2011. CrIS provides measurements of Earth view interferograms in three infrared spectral bands at 30 cross-track positions, each with a 3 × 3 array of field of views. The CrIS ground processing software transforms the measured interferograms into calibrated and geolocated spectra in the form of Sensor Data Records (SDRs) that cover spectral bands from 650 to 1095 cm {\`{A}}1 , 1210 to 1750 cm {\`{A}}1 , and 2155 to 2550 cm {\`{A}}1 with spectral resolutions of 0.625 cm {\`{A}}1 , 1.25 cm {\`{A}}1 , and 2.5 cm {\`{A}}1 , respectively. During the time since launch a team of subject matter experts from government, academia, and industry has been engaged in postlaunch CrIS calibration and validation activities. The CrIS SDR product is defined by three validation stages: Beta, Provisional, and Validated. The product reached Beta and Provisional validation stages on 19 April 2012 and 31 January 2013, respectively. For Beta and Provisional SDR data, the estimated absolute spectral calibration uncertainty is less than 3 ppm in the long-wave and midwave bands, and the estimated 3 sigma radiometric uncertainty for all Earth scenes is less than 0.3 K in the long-wave band and less than 0.2 K in the midwave and short-wave bands. The geolocation uncertainty for near nadir pixels is less than 0.4 km in the cross-track and in-track directions. Citation: Han, Y., et al.

Tskin from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) has not been properly exploited to date to assess its long-term spatio-temporal variability and no current homogenous Tskin record from IASI exists. In this study, we present a fast retrieval method of Tskin based on an artificial neural network from a set of IASI channels selected using the information theory/entropy reduction technique. We compare and validate our IASI Tskin product with that from EUMETSAT Level 2, ECMWF Reanalysis ERA5, SEVIRI land-surface temperature products, as well as ground measurements. Our results show good correlation between the IASI neural network product and the datasets used for validation, with a standard deviation between 1 and 4 °C. This method can be applied to other infrared measurements, and allows for the construction of a robust Tskin dataset, making it suitable for trend analysis.</p></p>},

abstract = {Large-scale hydrological models are nowadays mostly calibrated using observed discharge. As a result, a large part of the hydrological system, in particular the unsaturated zone, remains uncalibrated. Soil moisture observations from satellites have the potential to fill this gap. Here we evaluate the added value of remotely sensed soil moisture in calibration of large-scale hydrological models by addressing two research questions: (1) Which parameters of hydrological models can be identified by calibration with remotely sensed soil moisture? (2) Does calibration with remotely sensed soil moisture lead to an improved calibration of hydrological models compared to calibration based only on discharge observations, such that this leads to improved simulations of soil moisture content and discharge? A dual state and parameter Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to calibrate the hydrological model LISFLOOD for the Upper Danube. Calibration is done using discharge and remotely sensed soil moisture acquired by AMSR-E, SMOS, and ASCAT. Calibration with discharge data improves the estimation of groundwater and routing parameters. Calibration with only remotely sensed soil moisture results in an accurate identification of parameters related to land-surface processes. For the Upper Danube upstream area up to 40,000 km2, calibration on both discharge and soil moisture results in a reduction by 10–30% in the RMSE for discharge simulations, compared to calibration on discharge alone. The conclusion is that remotely sensed soil moisture holds potential for calibration of hydrological models, leading to a better simulation of soil moisture content throughout the catchment and a better simulation of discharge in upstream areas.},

abstract = {The process whereby the spatially distributed runoff (generated through saturation/infiltration excesses, subsurface flow, etc.) travels over the hillslope and river network and becomes streamflow is generally referred to as "routing". In short, routing is a runoff-to-streamflow process, and the streamflow in rivers is the response to runoff integrated in both time and space. Here we develop a methodology to invert the routing process, i.e., to derive the spatially distributed runoff from streamflow (e.g., measured at gauge stations) by inverting an arbitrary linear routing model using fixed interval smoothing. We refer to this streamflow-to-runoff process as "inverse routing". Inversion experiments are performed using both synthetically generated and real streamflow measurements over the Ohio River basin. Results show that inverse routing can effectively reproduce the spatial field of runoff and its temporal dynamics from sufficiently dense gauge measurements, and the inversion performance can also be strongly affected by low gauge density and poor data quality. <br><br> The runoff field is the only component in the terrestrial water budget that cannot be directly measured, and all previous studies used streamflow measurements in its place. Consequently, such studies are limited to scales where the spatial and temporal difference between the two can be ignored. Inverse routing provides a more sophisticated tool than traditional methods to bridge this gap and infer fine-scale (in both time and space) details of runoff from aggregated measurements. Improved handling of this final gap in terrestrial water budget analysis may potentially help us to use space-borne altimetry-based surface water measurements for cross-validating, cross-correcting, and assimilation with other space-borne water cycle observations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s) .},
